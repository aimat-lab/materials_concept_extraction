# Inference with llama models

Inference for trained models can be done by executing the python scripts `inference.py` and `inference-chat.py`.

On BWUniCluster, the corresponding `.sh` files can be used to submit the jobs to the cluster and demonstrate the usage of the script params.

Note: The paths to the training files must be adapted to match the folder structure on the cluster.
