# Train llama models

Training can be done by executing the python scripts train.py and train-chat.py (formats the data in a specific prompt)

On BWUniCluster, the corresponding `.sh` files can be used to submit the jobs to the cluster and demonstrate the usage of the script params.

Note: The paths to the training files must be adapted to match the folder structure on the cluster.
