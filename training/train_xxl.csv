Titanium dioxide, TiO2, is an important photocatalytic material that exists as two main polymorphs, anatase and rutile. The presence of either or both of these phases impacts on the photocatalytic performance of the material. The present work reviews the anatase to rutile phase transformation. The synthesis and properties of anatase and rutile are examined, followed by a discussion of the thermodynamics of the phase transformation and the factors affecting its observation. A comprehensive analysis of the reported effects of dopants on the anatase to rutile phase transformation and the mechanisms by which these effects are brought about is presented in this review, yielding a plot of the cationic radius versus the valence characterised by a distinct boundary between inhibitors and promoters of the phase transformation. Further, the likely effects of dopant elements, including those for which experimental data are unavailable, on the phase transformation are deduced and presented on the basis of this analysis."

Liquid phase sintering LPS is a process for forming high performance, multiple-phase components from powders. It involves sintering under conditions where solid grains coexist with a wetting liquid. Many variants of LPS are applied to a wide range of engineering materials. Example applications for this technology are found in automobile engine connecting rods and high-speed metal cutting inserts. Scientific advances in understanding LPS began in the 1950s. The resulting quantitative process models are now embedded in computer simulations to enable predictions of the sintered component dimensions, microstructure, and properties. However, there are remaining areas in need of research attention. This LPS review, based on over 2,500 publications, outlines what happens when mixed powders are heated to the LPS temperature, with a focus on the densification and microstructure evolution events."

Lead zirconate titanate PZT based piezoelectric materials are well known for their excellent piezoelectric properties. However, considering the toxicity of lead and its compounds, there is a general awareness for the development of environmental friendly lead-free materials as evidenced from the legislation passed by the European Union in this effect. Several classes of materials are now being considered as potentially attractive alternatives tofor specific applications. In this paper, attempts have been made to review the recent developments on lead-free piezo materials emphasizing on their preparation, structureproperty correlation, etc. In this context, perovskite systems such as bismuth sodium titanate, alkali niobates ANbO3, etc. and non-perovskites such as bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics are reviewed in detail. From the above study, it is concluded that some lead-free compositions show stable piezoelectric responses even though they do not match the overall performance of PZT. This has been the stimulant for growing research on this subject. This topic is of current interest to the researchers worldwide as evidenced from the large number of research publications. This has motivated us to come out with a review article with a view that it would give further impetus to the researchers already working in this area and also draw the attention of the others."

Some brittle epoxies can be toughened significantly by the addition of an elastomeric phase. A great deal of controversy still exists on the nature of the toughening mechanisms. In this work tensile dilatometry at constant displacement rates was used to determine whether voiding, crazing or shear banding are the deformation mechanisms. Diglycidyl ether-bisphenol A epoxies toughened by various levels of several types of carboxyl-terminated butadiene nitrile liquid rubber were studied. The results indicate that at low strain rates the rubber particles simply enhance shear deformation. At sufficiently high strain rates the rubber particles cavitate and subsequently promote further shear deformation. No indication of crazing as an important toughening mechanism is found. No significant effect of rubber particle size or type can be ascertained."

Microencapsulated dicyclopentadiene DCPD healing agent and Grubbs' Ru catalyst are incorporated into an epoxy matrix to produce a polymer composite capable of self-healing. The fracture toughness and healing efficiency of this composite are measured using a tapered double-cantilever beam TDCB specimen. Both the virgin and healed fracture toughness depend strongly on the size and concentration of microcapsules added to the epoxy. Fracture of the neat epoxy is brittle, exhibiting a mirror fracture surface. Addition of DCPD-filled urea-formaldehyde UF microcapsules yields up to 127% increase in fracture toughness and induces a change in the fracture plane morphology to hackle markings. The fracture toughness of epoxy with embedded microcapsules is much greater than epoxy samples with similar concentrations of silica microspheres or solid UF polymer particles. The increased toughening associated with fluid-filled microcapsules is attributed to increased hackle markings as well as subsurface microcracking not observed for solid particle fillers. Overall the embedded microcapsules provide two independent effects: the increase in virgin fracture toughness from general toughening and the ability to self-heal the virgin fracture event."

This paper deals with ultra-high-strength monofilaments of linear polyethylene that are produced by solution spinning and subsequent hot drawing at. The influence of the draw ratio on the mechanical and thermal properties of the fibres was investigated. Some salient features of a polyethylene filament with a draw ratio of 31.7 are: tensile strength at break=3.0 GPa, Young's modulus=90 GPa and DSC-melting point at a scan speed of min1=145.5 C. The modulus was found to depend linearly on the draw ratio. The tensile strength tended, by contrast, to approach an upper limit at high draw ratios. Additional morphological and X-ray studies revealed an extremely good orientation of the macromolecules in the fibre direction of the highly drawn polyethylene monofilaments."

The role Of matrix ductility on the toughenability and toughening mechanism of elastomer-modified, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A DGEBA-based epoxies is investigated. Matrix ductility is varied by using epoxide resins of varying epoxide monomer molecular weights. These epoxide resins are cured using 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulphone DDS and, in some cases, modified with 10 vol% carboxyl-terminated copolymer of butadiene and acrylonitrile CTBN. Fracture toughness values for the neat epoxies are found to be almost independent of the monomer molecular weight of the epoxide resin used. However, the fracture toughness of the elastomer-modified epoxies is found to be very dependent upon the epoxide monomer molecular weight. Tensile dilatometry indicates that the toughening mechanism, when present, is similar to the mechanism found for piperidine cured, elastomer-modified epoxies studied previously. Scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy techniques corroborate this finding."

The principal toughening mechanism of a substantially toughened, rubber-modified epoxy has again been shown to involve internal cavitation of the rubber particles and the subsequent formation of shear bands. Additional evidence supporting this sequence of events which provides a significant amount of toughness enhancement, is presented. However, in addition to this well-known mechanism, more subtle toughening mechanisms have been found in this work. Evidence for such mechanisms as crack deflection and particle bridging is shown under certain circumstances in rubber-modified epoxies. The occurrence of these toughening mechanisms appears to have a particle size dependence. Relatively large particles provide only a modest increase in fracture toughness by a particle bridging/crack deflection mechanism. In contrast, smaller particles provide a significant increase in toughness by cavitation-induced shear banding. A critical, minimum diameter for particles which act as bridging particles exists and this critical diameter appears to scale with the properties of the neat epoxy. Bimodal mixtures of epoxies containing small and large particles are also examined and no synergistic effects are observed."

Glass-ceramics are polycrystalline materials of fine microstructure that are produced by the controlled crystallisation devitrification of a glass. Numerous silicate based wastes, such as coal combustion ash, slag from steel production, fly ash and filter dusts from waste incinerators, mud from metal hydrometallurgy, different types of sludge as well as glass cullet or mixtures of them have been considered for the production of glass-ceramics. Developments of glass-ceramics from waste using different processing methods are described comprehensively in this review, covering R&D work carried out worldwide in the last 40 years. Properties and applications of the different glass-ceramics produced are discussed. The review reveals that considerable knowledge and expertise has been accumulated on the process of transformation of silicate waste into useful glass-ceramic products. These glass-ceramics are attractive as building materials for usage as construction and architectural components or for other specialised technical applications requiring a combination of suitable thermo-mechanical properties. Previous attempts to commercialise glass-ceramics from waste and to scale-up production for industrial exploitation are also discussed."

Due to the remarkable physical and mechanical properties of individual, perfect carbon nanotubes they are considered to be one of the most promising new reinforcements for structural composites. Their impressive electrical and thermal properties also suggest opportunities for multifunctional applications. In the context of inorganic matrix composites, researchers have particularly focussed onas toughening elements to overcome the intrinsic brittleness of the ceramic or glass material. Although there are now a number of studies published in the literature, these inorganic systems have received much less attention than CNT/polymer matrix composites. This paper reviews the current status of the research and development of CNT-loaded ceramic matrix composite CMC materials. It includes a summary of the key issues related to the optimisation of CNT-based composites, with particular reference to brittle matrices and provides an overview of the processing techniques developed to optimise dispersion quality, interfaces, and density. The properties of the various composite systems are discussed, with an emphasis on toughness; a comprehensive comparative summary is provided, together with a discussion of the possible toughening mechanism that may operate. Last, a range of potential applications are discussed, concluding with a discussion of the scope for future developments in the field."

Transient liquid phase TLP bonding is a relatively new bonding process that joins materials using an interlayer. On heating, the interlayer melts and the interlayer element or a constituent of an alloy interlayer diffuses into the substrate materials, causing isothermal solidification. The result of this process is a bond that has a higher melting point than the bonding temperature. This bonding process has found many applications, most notably the joining and repair of Ni-based superalloy components. This article reviews important aspects of TLP bonding, such as kinetics of the process, experimental details bonding time, interlayer thickness and format, and optimal bonding temperature, and advantages and disadvantages of the process. A wide range of materials that TLP bonding has been applied to is also presented. Partial transient liquid phase PTLP bonding is a variant of TLP bonding that is typically used to join ceramics. PTLP bonding requires an interlayer composed of multiple layers; the most common bond setup consists of a thick refractory core sandwiched by thin, lower-melting layers on each side. This article explains how the experimental details and bonding kinetics of PTLP bonding differ from TLP bonding. Also, a range of materials that have been joined by PTLP bonding is presented."

The present paper investigates the effect of adding silica nanoparticles to an anhydride-cured epoxy polymer in bulk and when used as the matrix of carbon- and glass-fibre reinforced composites. The formation of hybrid epoxy polymers, containing both silica nanoparticles and carboxyl-terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile CTBN rubber microparticles, is also discussed. The structure/property relationships are considered, with an emphasis on the toughness and the toughening mechanisms. The fracture energy of the bulk epoxy polymer was increased from 77 to 212J/m2 by the presence of 20wt% of silica nanoparticles. The observed toughening mechanisms that were operative were a plastic shear-yield bands, and b debonding of the matrix from the silica nanoparticles, followed by plastic void-growth of the epoxy. The largest increases in toughness observed were for the hybrid materials. Here a maximum fracture energy of 965J/m2 was measured for a hybrid epoxy polymer containing 9wt% and 15wt% of the rubber microparticles and silica nanoparticles, respectively. Most noteworthy was the observation that these increases in the toughness of the bulk polymers were found to be transferred to the fibre composites. Indeed, the interlaminar fracture energies for the fibre-composite materials were increased even further by a fibre-bridging toughening mechanism. The present work also extends an existing model to predict the toughening effect of the nanoparticles in a thermoset polymer. There was excellent agreement between the predictions and the experimental data for the epoxy containing the silica nanoparticles, and for epoxy polymers containing micrometre-sized glass particles. The latter, relatively large, glass particles were investigated to establish whether a nano-effect, with respect to increasing the toughness of the epoxy bulk polymers, did indeed exist."

This paper aims to optimize the fabrication method and to fabricate good natural rubber basedwith high modulus by investigating the influences of a variety of fabrication conditions on theperformances, such as matrix type, external magnetic flux density, and temperature, plasticizer and iron particles. Among these factors, the content of iron particles plays a most important contribution in shear modulus.

The results were used to generate a predictive flow stress model over the entire range of test conditions. The effect of initial austenite grain size on flow stress was found to follow the HallPetch relationship. This dependency was then removed through innovative heat treatments. The morphology of the flow stress curves were also dependent on mechanisms of microstructural evolution which were controlled by the test method, strain rate and temperature. Friction and adiabatic heating also had a major contribution. A novel method was proposed in order to define the flow stress, which was then used to determine the work hardening exponent of the ZenerHollomon equation. It was found that a deviation from the linear trend was observed in Hopkinson Pressure Bar tests and reasons were given. An artificial neural network approach was used to determine a more accurate predictive flow stress model which included the effects of test method, temperature, stain rate and initial austenite grain size.

For this particular study, the combination of WA 5%, 10%, and 15% by binder weight and SF5 %, 10%, and 15% by binder weight were utilized as supplementary binder materials to produce foamed concrete mixes.was made evident from micrographs obtained in the study, the improvement observed in the compressive strength of the foamed concrete was due to a significant densification in the microstructure of the cement paste matrix in the presence of WA and SF hybrid supplementary binders. Experimental results indicated that the combination of 15% SF and 5% WA by binder weight had a more substantial influence on the compressive strength of foamed concrete compared to the control mix. Furthermore, the addition of WA and SF significantly prolonged the setting times of the blended cement paste of the foamed concrete."

In this study, the effects of curing white Portland cement WPC and hydroxyapatite mixed with white Portland cement HAp/WPC pastes in water and the in vitro biological environment on the compressive strength and bone-like apatite formation were examined. The compressive strength of both WPC and HAp/WPC pastes increased with longer curing periods in water. The compressive strength of WPC and HAp/WPC pastes was 51.88 and 25.67 MPa, respectively, after curing in water for 28 days. The compressive strength of both samples continuously increased during in vitro testing in a simulated body fluid SBF. After 4 weeks of immersion in a SBF, the strengths of cured WPC and HAp/WPC samples were 59.01 and 28.06 MPa, respectively. It is due to continued hydration of WPC. The addition of HAp to WPC decreased the compressive strength of the sample. Alternatively, it enhanced bone-like apatite formation on the surface of the samples."

In this study, the effect of friction stir processing FSP by various transverse welding speeds of 50150mm/min on mechanical properties and microstructure of Fe-24Ni-0.3C TRIP steel was investigated. The results showed that defectless FSPed specimen was obtained at the transverse speed of 100mm/min. Microstructural analysis was carried out by scanning electron microscope equipped with electron backscattered diffraction EBSD detector. It was found that by increasing the transverse speed, more significant grain refinement was observed in the stir zone. Furthermore, deformation induced martensite was not observed in the area subjected to FSP. Significant grain refinement resulted from dynamic recrystallization was found to be responsible for hindering formation of deformation induced martensite in the weldment section after tensile deformation test. Tensile test results showed that yield strength YS was increased from 145MPa to 210MPa in the FSPed specimens. However, tensile elongation was restricted in the FSP processed specimens which may be due to limitation of TRIP phenomenon."

Knowledge of the nonlinear elastic response and anharmonic properties of MgO single crystal is important for interpreting the seismically observed velocity variations in the Earths mantle and constructing reliable mineralogical modes of the Earths interior. However, investigations on these properties of it have not been performed sufficiently to date. So the nonlinear elastic response of the MgO is first studied by calculating the second-, third-, and fourth-order elastic constants. Results show that our predications on the high-order elastic constants exhibit excellent agreement with the available experimental ones and other theoretical values, which indicates that the present computational approach is suitable for the calculations of the high-order elastic constants and it can be expanded into other complex systems. Then on the basis of the elastic constants, the related anharmonic properties such as the first-order pressure derivatives of the second- and third-order elastic constants, Gruneisen constants of the long-wavelength acoustic modes, and ultrasonic nonlinear parameters are also investigated.

Pure graphite, coke, and charcoal were used as the carbon material substrates. The reduction rates were evaluated by sampling at different reduction times and by analyzing the chemical compositions of the reduced slag and the produced metal. The carbothermic FeO reduction from slag is initially fast followed by a much slower reduction rate. However, the rate of the MnO reduction is slow in the fast FeO reduction stage, and it starts to increase significantly during the slow FeO reduction stage. The kinetics of FeO and MnO reduction are affected by the type of carbonaceous materials. Moreover, the rate of the carbon dissolution/transfer into the produced metal phase and the amount of the transferred manganese to the metal phase depend on the type of carbon. Based on the experimental observations and the thermodynamic calculations, a mechanism for MnO reduction was proposed. According to this mechanism, MnO is mainly reduced through a metallothermic reduction by Fe and the rate of MnO reduction is controlled by the rate of the consumption of FeO from the slag, which takes place simultaneously. In contrast, the rate of FeO reduction in the fast initial reduction stage is controlled by the rate of the carbon dissolution/transfer into the metal phase. However, at the second slow FeO reduction stage, it is reduced mainly by the solid carbon."

The U-shaped girder is a type of open thin-walled structure, which is used in urban rail transit engineering. Although it employs polypropylene fiber concrete to avoid cracks, the girder is still easier to crack than other traditional structures owing to its special open thin-walled cross section. In this study, a cracking accident of a U-shaped girder, which happened during the prestressed steel tensioning, was studied by field investigation and mechanical analysis through the finite element FE method. An outline of the cracks was presented. The nonlinear material properties of the polypropylene fiber concrete and steel were discussed and used in the finite element model. The effects of the main design parameters, such as the flange slab thickness, anchorage position, and prestressed steel layout, were evaluated based on the results of the FE analysis. The results indicate that the extremely low rigidity of the web and oversize of the web longitudinal prestressed steels are the main reasons for the cracks. The risk of cracks can be reduced by increasing the thickness of the flange slab and changing the anchorage position and prestressed steel layout.

Initial residual compressive stresses between 20 and 65MPa result from the machining processes before T6 heat treatment. During the first temperature cycle the residual stresses in all materials change to tension at almost all Tmax. The peak value of the residual stresses reaches 50 up to 65MPa and is nearly independent from Tmax. Damage evolution was observed by light optical microscope and SEM after the same cycles as the residual stress measurements. Grain boundary reliefs arise and increase in all materials with increasing number of TF cycles and intergranular damage of EN AW-6061 and the matrix alloy of theis observed.

This article documents a basic investigation of the vibration and acoustic behaviors of some PCMS through practical, analytical and numerical approaches, in order to evaluate the possibilities for minimizing, the transmission of noise and vibration. Some of these materials were made and investigated over frequency ranges which include several commonly-encountered vibration and acoustic frequencies of automotive and some other structures. Observations from this work are therefore expected to contribute towards design inputs to obtain better performances. A novel investigation of the effects upon vibration response of even slight inaccuracies of cutting out samples from larger blanks of such materials has also been made."

In this work, the reconstruction effects for NiO001 and oxygen terminated NiO111 p22 surfaces have been investigated. The projector augmented wave method together with the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics scheme have been used to determine the atomic geometry and electronic ground state. The correlation effects of the Ni d electrons are treated using a meanfield multi-orbital Hubbard correction, the so-called LDA+ U approximation, to the local spin density Hamiltonian where LDA stands for the local-density approximation and U for the Hubbard interaction. The LDA+ U calculation shows that the reconstruction effects as well as the changes of the electronic structure of the NiO001 surface are small compared to the unreconstructed surface. On the contrary, the oxygen-terminated NiO111 p22 polar surface exhibits important reconstruction effects and changes of the electronic structure, that provide additional stabilization of this polar surface."

Several materials have been used as surgical implants since the 16th century. Materials can be implanted in the human body; however, the choice of the appropriate material is based on the required mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological properties. Until now two classes of metals namely stainless steel and cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys became known as materials for implant applications. They were considered suitable for surgical implant procedures but many researchers and surgeons were not completely satisfied with their performance. The main problem of the modern science is to find a material that perfectly restores tissues damaged after accidents or diseases. The trend of the current research in orthopedic prosthesis is based on the development of titanium alloys composed of non-toxic elements with low modulus of elasticity. Powder metallurgy techniques have beenused to produce controlled porous structures such as the porous coating applied for dental and orthopedic surgical implants which allows bone tissue grown within the implant surface, improving fixation. The development of porous metallic biomaterials associated with their biomedical applications is an important research area. To obtain a good one implant successful therapy the composition, size, form and topography of the alloys are extremely important."

A Double-Gate Armchair-Graphene Nanoribbon FET is proposed to realize a high-sensitive and small-size biosensor in order to detect DNA without high-cost and time-consuming labeling process. Two nanogap cavities open inside the top and bottom gate oxides by the method of sacrificed layer etching. When the DNA biomolecule is introduced to the nanogap cavity, the hybridization event which is actually the formation of a double-strand of DNA will occur thus electrically modulating the GNR channel leading to a change in the drain current. The important report of this research is about attained high sensitivity of the proposed biosensor for a vast spectrum of the DNA biological samples. It is worth noting that a DNA sequence by 23 nucleotides extracted from Neisseria gonorrhoeae can be detected as a special case. An extensive numerical approach has been applied in order to characterize the proposed biosensor. The suggested biosensor has been evaluated by solving Schrodinger equation SE with Non-Equilibrium Green Function NEGF method in the mode-space coupled into Poisson solver in a self-consistent manner assuming ballistic limit. Two different expressions of sensitivity in terms of the threshold voltage and current have been defined giving a good metric for the sensitivity analysis. The results revealed a relative sensitivity of 1mV/nm2 by a filled area by the DNA about 120nm2 showing the excellent superiority for the proposed biosensor as compared to other counterparts. The effective area of the proposed biosensor obtains 240nm2 which is very small in comparison with other reports highlighting high capability of the biosensor in the detection. It has been shown that the proposed biosensor can be implemented in ultra-scaling domain resulting in considerable increase in the sensitivity promising a potent and reliable candidate for high-sensitive and small-size biosensors. Also, the technical issues on designing the suggested biosensor have been investigated to achieve a useful guideline in detection and identification of the target"

We find that the temperature of the shocked material decreases with increasing Cint and decreasing coupling and quantify these effects. Our simulations also show that the threshold for plastic deformation the Hugoniot elastic limit depends on the properties of the internal DoFs while the threshold for failure is very insensitive to them.

The idea of insulating individual high-temperature superconducting HTS tapes was explored as a dielectric design to reduce the risk and complexity of HTS cable manufacturing. Applying insulation on individual HTS tapes is amenable to continuous manufacturing processes and opens up material choices for the insulation. In this study, heat shrink insulation was selected as the material choice for exploring the possibility of this design philosophy because of its commercial availability in multiple thicknesses. A systematic set of selection criteria was developed for the selection of appropriate heat shrink for given HTS tape dimensions. The cryogenic dielectric characteristics of insulated HTS tapes were evaluated both in liquid nitrogen and gaseous helium environments at. Dielectric characteristics of tapes with a single layer of thicker insulation were compared with those insulated using multiple layers of thinner insulation to evaluate the relative merits of each method. Several model power cables were fabricated using the PET insulated tapes, and their dielectric behavior was evaluated at in gaseous helium environment. The results suggest that the explored method is useful for HTS power cables operating at low voltages &lt;1,000 V primarily due to the limitation on achieving thick insulation with high quality using heat shrink tubing.

Boron ion implantation into pre-amorphized silicon is studied. Pre-amorphization is performed either by F + or Si + implantation prior to B + implantation at 10keV with 310 15 ions/cm 2 . Broadening of the boron profile can be suppressed markedly in the pre-amorphized layers. For instance, the as-implanted depth at a B concentration of 110 18 atoms/cm 3 decreases from 0.19 to 0.1m for implantation into a pre-amorphized layer compared to B implantation into crystalline silicon. After annealing at, B atoms diffuse much more rapidly in the pre-amorphized layers than in the crystalline silicon case. Nevertheless, shallower junctions are obtained with the use of pre-amorphization.

In contrast, abrasive polishing in a directional and random manner resulted in polyurethane surfaces having sub-micron scale features orientated in a linear or random manner. Results show that when compared with flat non-patterned polymer, both the laser processed and abrasive polished surface having randomly organised features, promoted significantly greater cell adhesion, while also enhancing cell proliferation after 72h. In contrast, the abrasive polished surface having linear features did not enhance cell adhesion or proliferation when compared to the flat surface. For cell migration, the cells growing on the laser processed and abrasively polished random surface showed decreased levels of migration when compared to the flat surface. This study shows that both abrasive polishing and laser processing can be used to produce surfaces having features on the nano-scale and micron-scale, respectively. Surfaces produced using both techniques can be used to promote fibroblast cell adhesion and proliferation. Thus both methods offer a viable alternative to using lithographic techniques for developing patterned surfaces. In particular, abrasive polishing is an attractive method due to it being a simple, rapid and inexpensive method that can be used to produce surfaces having features on a comparable scale to more expensive, multi-step methods."

UMOSFET is theoretically suitable to decrease the on-resistance of the MOSFET. In this study, in order to determine the cell structure of the SiCUMOSFET with extremely low on-resistance, influences of the orientation of the trench and the off-angle of the wafer on the MOS properties are investigated. The channel resistance, gate IV curves and instability of threshold voltage are superior on the {11-20} planes as compared with other planes. On the vicinal off wafer, influence of the off-angle disappears and the properties on the equivalent planes are almost the same. The obtained results indicate that the extremely low on-resistance with the high stability and high reliability is possible in the SiCUMOSFET by the hexagonal cell composed of the six {11-20} planes on the vicinal off wafer, and actually an extremely low channel resistance was demonstrated on the hexagonal UMOSFET with the six {11-20} planes on the vicinal off wafer."

Lightness and high specific strength make magnesium alloys ideal materials for the transportation industry, especially the automotive sector that is struggling to cope with the everyday more stringent regulations on emission of carbon dioxide. Wrought magnesium alloys are difficult to deform because of the few active slip systems characteristic of their hexagonal close-packed lattice. Consequently, most of the commercially available magnesium alloys are alloys based on the MgAl binary system used in casting processes. The improvement of the mechanical properties of these alloys cannot be achieved by means of grain refinement using Zr due to the formation of Zr aluminides. In this study we propose a novel chemical composition that can refine all types of Mg alloys as proved in the Al-containing AM50 Mg alloy. We demonstrate that NbB inoculation of Mg alloys promotes the formation of heterogeneously nucleated primary -Mg grains leading to the reduction of the grain size and this is obtained over a wide range of cooling rates. We also show that the grain refinement achieved leads to the improvement of the properties of high pressure die cast Mg automotive components and has the potential to enhance the mechanical properties of cast Mg alloys."

Among metallic materials used as bone substitutes, titanium alloys gain an increasing importance because of their low modulus, high corrosion resistance and good biocompatibility. In this work, an investigation of the in vitro cytocompatibility of a recently new developed -type Ti-25Ta-25Nb alloy was carried out by evaluating the behavior of human osteoblasts. The metallic Ti-6Al-4V biomaterial, which is one of representative + type titanium alloys for biomedical applications, and Tissue Culture Polystyrene TCPS, were also investigated as reference Ti-based material and control substrate, respectively. Both metallic surfaces were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The cellular response was quantified by assessments of viability, cell attachment and spreading, cell morphology, production and extracellular organization of fibronectin and cell proliferation. Polished surfaces from both materials having an equiaxed grain microstructure and nanometre scale surface roughness elicited an essentially identical osteoblast response in terms of all analyzed cellular parameters. Thus, on both surfaces the cells displayed high survival rates, good cell adhesion and spreading, a dense and randomly dispersed fibronectin matrix and increasing cell proliferation rates over the incubation time. Furhermore, the enhanced biological performance of Ti-25Ta-25Nb was highly supported by the results obtained in comparison with TCPS. These findings, together with previously shown superelastic behavior, low Young's modulus and high corrosion resistance, recommend Ti-25Ta-25Nb as good candidate for applications in bone implantology."

Here attention is focused on two viscoplastic models for perovskite type ferroelectrics undergoing a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition. Both models incorporate 90 and 180 domain switching, but differ in a number of representative domain orientations, which is 6 and 42, respectively. Different parameterisations for the models were tested, with a special emphasis on orientation effects in the behaviour of poled ferroelectrics under multi-axial loading as well as on rate effects.

Although the airarc cutting process has been widely used in the material processing engineering, little information about temperature, stress and microstructure in the plate airarc cut is known. A three-dimensional finite element model including the material removal and the thermal effect of the arc is developed to study the temperature and stress fields of 10Ni5CrMoV steel plate during airarc cutting process in this paper. The microstructures and micro-mechanical properties of the parts near the groove especially in heat affected zone HAZ are studied by experimental methods, and they also can be used as a method to verify the numerical results. Effects of stresses induced by airarc cutting process on the initial residual stress fields of base materials are also researched. The results show that the cooling velocity in HAZ is higher than the one of the welding process for the same base material, and the zone with high temperature is very narrow, which means that the temperature gradients near the groove are very steep during the airarc cutting process; this special temperature field depresses multiphase transformations and coarse microstructures. The evolution of the stress during the airarc cutting is described, and the numerical results indicate that the characteristics of the evolution of stresses and the residual stresses distribution in the plate in airarc cutting process seem to be similar to the ones of the butt welding for flat plates. The influences of airarc cutting process on initial stress fields present two aspects: thermal effect and material removal effect, and the former plays a primary role. Both numerical temperature and stress fields are compared with the experimental ones. It is very important for researchers to clarify the temperatures, stresses and microstructures in the plate during airarc cutting process, and understand fully the mechanism of influences of airarc cutting on the plate; it is also very valuable for engineering application of the airarc cutting process."

Pipeline steel in soil containing water could induce a macro tensile stress, leading to stress corrosion cracking SCC. Anisotropic corrosion-induced stress of Fe single crystal is studied by molecular dynamics MD in this paper. The surface perpendicular to the z direction is subjected to the corrosion, and the process of corrosion along three crystallographic directions is simulated using MD approach. When the surface with one specific orientation is corroded, two cases are considered: one is that the periodic boundary condition is applied along the x direction, while free boundary condition along the y direction; and the other is that the periodic boundary condition along the y direction, while free boundary condition along the x direction. The results show that both the deflection of the free end and the macro tensile stress of the crystal for the corrosion in three crystallographic orientations are increasing with the increase of the relative depth of the porous layer. The values of the deflection and the macro tensile stress for the two cases depend on the orientation with the free boundary condition when the surface with one specific orientation is corroded. Moreover, the smaller the interplanar spacing along the orientation with the free boundary condition is, the larger the deflection and the macro tensile stress are."

In this paper the authors describe a technique based on synchrotron x-ray diffraction which has been used to produce full 3D grain maps both grain shapes and orientations in annealed aluminium alloy and stainless steel samples containing around 500 grains. The procedure is termed diffraction contrast tomography DCT, reflecting its similarities with conventional absorption contrast tomography. It is an extension of the 3D X-ray diffraction microscopy 3DXRD concept, and has been developed in collaboration with its inventors. The specimen is illuminated using a monochromatic synchrotron x-ray beam, and grains imaged using the extinction contrast that appears in the transmitted beam when grains are aligned in the diffraction condition during rotation of the sample. The beams of radiation diffracted by the grains are captured simultaneously on the same detector as the direct beam image. The combination of diffraction and extinction information aids the grain indexing operation, in which pairs of diffraction and extinction images are assigned to grain sets. 3D grain shapes are determined by algebraic reconstruction from the limited number of extinction projections, while crystallographic orientation is found from the diffraction geometry. The non-destructive nature of the technique allows for in-situ studies of mapped samples. Research is in progress to extend the technique to allow the determination of the elastic strain and stress tensors on a grain-by-grain basis."

In this study, a new method was presented for preparing narrowly size distributed copper powders from CuO slurry by wet chemical reduction with hydrazine used as a reductant. The rapid nucleation was first induced by a very fast reduction of Pd2+ resulted from batch process. Subsequently copper species which contribute to the growth on the formed Pdo nuclei was slowly generated by semibatch process.

This paper describes the main results from an investigation into the consequences of thermo-hydrogen refinement of microstructure THRM after laser powder bed fusion LPBF of Ti6Al4V on the evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties using a set of experimental techniques. Porosity fraction, grain structure, phases, and crystallographic texture per phase are characterized using micro X-ray computed tomography, microscopy, and neutron diffraction. A hierarchical structure of acicular -phase morphology formed inside the prior grains by fast cooling during LPBF transforms into fine-grained globular microstructure by THRM, which facilitates homogeneous nucleation and growth of the low temperature phase with some retained phase. Moreover, hydrogenated material during THRM has low activation energy for diffusion, which in conjunction with the surface energy of pores causes densification of the material, thereby closing porosity formed during LPBF. Such significant microstructural changes induced by the THRM treatment cause brittle material created by LPBF to become ductile. Significantly, the strength and ductility produced by THRM exceed the minimums set forth by the ASTM B348 standard for Ti-6Al-4V. Moreover, the treatment improves fatigue strength of the material. In particular, it improves the endurance limit and reduces the scatter in the measured fatigue strength data. Performance characteristics of the material can be further optimized for specific application requirements by tailoring microstructures using the LPBF and THRM processes."

The ozone desizing and bleaching process was carried out at fixed PH values 6 in four different ozonation times and two different ozone doses. The rate of water pickup in fabrics was 60%. It has been determined that as ozonation time and the ozone dose increase, the degree of whiteness and water absorption of the terry fabric increases. However, the increase in the ozonation time did not cause a significant change in the low ozone doses; the change in the ozonation time at high ozone doses is causing a marked change in the investigated properties of the towel fabric. The degree of hydrophilicity and whiteness achieved after ozonation was found to be close to the results obtained in conventional bleaching. However it was seen that although acceptable water absorbency was obtained by the ozone desizing method, these values were lower than those of the conventional desizing method. Ozone bleaching and desizing do not require the consumption of water, the consumption of heat energy, and the use of any chemical additive that harms the environment with its wastes.a result, owing to ecofriendly, saving energy and acceptable fabric properties with regard to whiteness and absorptivity, ozone bleaching can be applied instead of the conventional bleaching and desizing method."

In order to characterize the respective importance of the growth stresses, thermal stresses and stress relaxation developed in oxide scales, two high temperature chambers for X-ray diffraction were designed, allowing us to determine the stresses in both the oxide and the substrate with the sin2 technique, at high temperatures or room temperature and during heating-cooling sequences. It was applied to NiNiO. At room temperature after oxidation, NiO is subjected to compressive stresses whose level depends on the substrate thickness and on the oxidation time and temperature. In the substrate, compressive stresses are mainly due to internal oxidation. During oxidation at, the oxide scale is subjected to slight tensile stresses which can be due partially to anionic diffusion, internal oxidation or the heating process. During heating-cooling sequences, the stresses in the scale decrease with increasing temperature and become negligible when the oxidation temperature is reached. The reversibility of the stress-temperature curve indicates that no stress relaxation occurs. The stresses found at room temperature are due only to thermal stresses and fit well the theoretical calculation of thermal stresses in NiO scale based on the newly determined thermal expansion coefficients of Ni and NiO. All these results show that the stresses found at room temperature are mainly generated during cooling and that the effect of the Pilling-Bedworth ratio or of factors playing a role during isothermal growth is negligible."

Combining the advantages of spark plasma sintering SPS and incomplete sintering IS in preparation of Si3N4 ceramics, the spark plasma incomplete sintering SPIS was presented to fabricate porous Si3N4 ceramics. Considering balancing the contradictory relationship between the porosity and toughness, 1 wt% multilayer graphene MLG was incorporated into porous Si3N4 ceramics. Meanwhile, for the sake of compensating for the decrease in the hardness of porous Si3N4 ceramics induced by MLG, 08 wt% -Si3N4 whisker -Si3N4 w were synergistically added. The element distribution, phase constitutions and microstructures of MLG/-Si3N4 w -reinforced porous Si3N4 ceramics were characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy EDS, x-rays diffraction XRD and scanning electron microscope SEM. The effects of -Si3N4 w content on porosity, hardness and fracture toughness of porous Si3N4 -based ceramics were analyzed. Results indicated that the porosity of porous Si3N4 -based ceramics reached 21%, and then decreased significantly after the -Si3N4 w content exceeded 4 wt%. The hardness of porous Si3N4 -based ceramics obtained the maximum value 2.81 GPa when - Si3N4 w was added 8 wt%, which was 31.92% higher than monolithic porous Si3N4 ceramic. The mass transfer, diffusion and fusion induced by -Si3N4 w were considered to be the main responsible for the increase of hardness. The fracture toughness of specimen with 1 wt% MLG and 4 wt% -Si3N4 w was advanced to 3.14 MPa m 1/2/ , which was 15.44% higher than monolithic porous Si3N4 ceramic. The markedly enhanced of the fracture toughness was attributed to the synergistic effects of crack deflection, pull-out and bridging resulted by MLG/-Si3N4 w . Spark plasma incomplete sintering was proposed to fabricate porous Si3N4 ceramics. MLG/-Si3N4 w were doped into porous Si3N4 ceramics to advance its strength.

The use of composite materials, such as carbon-fiber reinforced plastic CFRP composites, aero- structures has led to an increased need of advanced assembly joining and repair technologies. Adhesive bonded repairs as an alternative to recover full or part of initial strength were investigated. Tests were conducted with the objective of evaluating the effectiveness of techniques used for repairing damage fiber reinforced laminated composites. Failure loads and failure modes were generated and compared with the following parameters: scarf angles, roughness of grind tool and number of external plies. Results showed that scarf angle was the critical parameter and the largest tensile strength was observed with the smallest scarf angle. Besides, the use of external plies at the outer surface could not increase the repairs efficiency for large scarf angle. Preparing the repair surfaces by sanding them with a sander ranging from 60 to 100 grit number had significant effect on the failure load. These results allowed the proposal of design principles for repairing CFRP structures."

For the first time, -Cyclodextrin -CD attachment to graphene quantum dot GQD structure was performed using simultaneous electrodeposition of GQD and -CD on the surface of glassy carbon electrode GCE. Cyclic voltammetry at potential range -1.0 to 1.0V from mixture of GQD and -CD produced a well-defined -CD-GQD deposited on the surface of glassy carbon electrode. -CD-GQD modified GCE was used as a new electrocatalytical nanocomposite towards electrooxidation of Vitamin C as sample analyte. The synergistic effects and the catalytic activity of the -CD-GQD modified GCE were investigated by cyclic voltammetry CV, differential pulse voltammetry DPV chronoamperometry CA and square wave voltammetry SWV. The process of oxidation involved and its kinetics were established by using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry techniques. It has been found that in the course of an anodic potential sweep the electro-oxidation of Vitamin C is catalyzed by synergetic effect of -CD and GQD through a mediated electron transfer mechanism. Therefore, -CD-GQDs promote the rate of oxidation by increasing the peak current. The cyclic voltammetric results indicate that -CD-GQDs-GCE can remarkably enhance electroactivity towards the oxidation of Vitamin C in buffer solution. We have illustrated that the as-obtained -CD-GQDs-GCE exhibited a much higher electrocatalytical behavior thanfor the electrooxidation and detection of Vitamin C which was about two fold higher than for The electrochemical behavior was further exploited as detection scheme for the Vitamin C electrooxidation by square wave voltammetry."

It was found that TiC nanoparticles were distributed along -Al grain boundaries, which formed network architecture, and average cell size of the TiC network was 48m. The 20241.5TiC nanocomposite exhibited enhanced mechanical properties compared to 2024 base alloy. The ultimate tensile strength at was increased from 105MPa to 151MPa, with elongation reasonably decreasing from 9.5% to 7.1%. It was observed that the presence of the TiC network transformed deformation behavior of -Al matrix from local deformation to overall deformation during tensile test at high temperature. This enhanced strength of the 20241.5TiC, which contributed to ~84% increase in yield strength theoretically. Accordingly, a new strengthening mechanism named as constraint strengthening has been put forward in this paper. This principle was supposed to be applicable for microstructure design of other alloys and composites. In addition, the circle network was shifted to be oval one during deformation, but the interconnectivity has not been broken. This produced reasonably high ductility for the 20241.5TiC nanocomposite."

Engineered skin coverings have been adopted clinically to support extensive and deep wounds that result in fewer healthy skin remaining and therefore take longer to heal. Nonetheless, these biomaterials demand intensive labor and an expensive final cost. In comparison to conventional bandages, which do not meet all the requirements of wound care, electrospun fiber mats could potentially provide an excellent environment for healing. In this work, we developed two nanostructured scaffolds based on polyamide-6 PA-6 to be tested as a wound covering in a rat model of full-thickness incisional wound healing. The central idea was to create a bioconstruct that is simple to implement and biologically safe, with a high survival rate, which provides physical support and biological recognition for new functional tissues. An unmodified PA-6 and a soybean-modified PA-6 were employed as nanofibrillar matrices in this study. The biomaterials showed a dimensional homology to natural extracellular matrix components and neither in vitro toxicity nor in vivo side effects. Both polymeric scaffolds were resistant to the sterilization process and could promote the attachment of 3T3 fibroblast cells, besides successfully incorporating the growth factor PDGF-BB, which had its bioactivity extended for up to 12 h under simulated conditions. The modification of PA-6 chains with a fatty acid derivative increased the scaffold's surface free energy, favoring cell proliferation, collagen formation, and ECM secretion. These results confirm the potential of these materials as a topical dermal covering for skin regeneration."

Firstly, after optimizing its lattice parameters, a band structure is calculated by density functional theory with local density approximation DFT-LDA, on-site Coulomb interaction LDA+U, quasi-particle approximation GWA and Tran and Blahas modified BeckeJohnson exchangecorrelation potentials TB09. Both LDA+U and G0W0 calculations are accurate for the indirect band gap, but fail for the direct one. While QPscGW calculations do perturbative corrections to both G0W0 indirect and direct band gap in the same amount, it is leading to an overestimation of the indirect band gap and an underestimation of the direct one at the same time. Besides, the indirect and direct band gap of the optimized lattice parameters are calculated by ABINIT code with TB09 exchange functional and they are underestimated by about 1% and 17%, respectively. For comparison purposes with the experimental values, the band structure is also calculated by ELK code with TB09 and with a minuscule amount of charge removed from its primitive unit cell. With a charge removal by 0.86 both band gaps are very close to the experimental values, with an error of about 0.2% for the indirect band gap and about 0.9% for the direct one. Finally, the dielectric function and optical conductivity of the bulk CuBO2 are calculated by random phase approximation RPA and time-dependent density functional theory TDDFT on top of the TB09 electronic structure."

This research addresses the suitability of sugarcane bagasse ash SCBA in concrete used as partial cement replacement. Two grades of concrete M15 and M20 were used for the experimental analysis. The cement was partially replaced by SCBA at 0%, 5%, and 10%, by weight in normal strength concrete NSC. The innovative part of this study is to consider two grades of concrete mixes to evaluate the performance of concrete while cement is replaced by sugarcane bagasse ash. The cylindrical specimens having size 150 mm 300 mm were used and tested after curing period of 7, 14 and 28 days. It was observed through the experimental work that the compressive strength increases with incorporating SCBA in concrete. Results indicated that the use of SCBA in concrete M20 at 5% increased the average amount of compressive strength by 12% as compared to the normal strength concrete. The outcome of this work indicates that maximum strength of concrete could be attained at 5% replacement of cement with SCBA. Furthermore, the SCBA also gives compatible slump values which increase the workability of concrete."

Fatigue crack in salt water, air and high vacuum was studied in a spray-formed 2618 Al alloy reinforced with 15 vol.% SiC particulates and in the corresponding unreinforced alloy. The composite exhibited better fatigue crack growth resistance than the monolithic alloy in the three environments, although the differences decreased as the crack growth rate increased. The differences in the fatigue crack growth rates between the two materials were attributed to the higher closure levels in the composite, induced by its smaller crack-opening displacements. The presence of SiC particulates did not modify the susceptibility of this Al alloy to corrosion fatigue, the crack growth rates being maxima in salt water and minima in high vacuum."

The stress applied to a specimen does not fully act to deform material. The effective stress which actually acts on dislocations can be related to the internal stress of material. The origin of internal stress and thus effective stress has been discussed here by means of a dislocation model, concluding that internal stress depends on the dislocation structure. Based on this conclusion, fatigue tests were carried out and the following results were obtained:1 The behavior of internal stress in the fatigue process showed a clear difference between the over-stressed and the under-stressed conditions.2 The fatigue failure occurred under many-fold multiple repeated stress in two stress levels below the fatigue limit. Such fracture was attributed to the instability of internal stress.3 The concept of internal stress and effective stress is useful to the comprehensive understanding of fatigue phenomenon."

The results of a study on the properties of glass fibres after thermal conditioning at typical engineering thermoplastic processing temperatures are presented. The mechanical performance of rovings and single fibres of well-defined silane- and water-sized E-glass fibre samples was investigated at room temperature after thermal conditioning at temperatures up to. Thermal conditioning for 15 min led to strength degradation of >50 % at higher temperatures. The tensile strength of silane-coated fibres was relatively stable up to but exhibited a precipitous drop at higher conditioning temperatures. The water-sized fibres exhibited an approximately linear decrease in strength with increasing conditioning temperature. The strength distribution of the water-sized fibres could be well represented by a unimodal three-parameter Weibull distribution. The strength distributions of the sized fibres were more complicated and required the use of a bimodal Weibull distribution. The results are discussed in terms of the changes in surface coating and bulk glass structure during heat conditioning.

Photovoltaic module was produced from 31 solar cells with the largest short-circuit current, which were joined in series. Findings: In order to obtain a device producing an electrical current with a higher current and voltage level, solar cells were connected in a photovoltaic module and then protected from damages derived from external factors.

The proposed approach allows to overcome mesh-dependency and divergence problems encountered by direct methods in presence of softening laws. Isotropic elastic damage behaviour is retained for the cement matrix, on the basis of existing triaxial tests.

To study the effect of microstructures on these failures, supporting ancillary tests including all-weld tension coupons, Charpy V-notched impact tests, and optical and scanning electron microscope analyses were performed. The favored microstructures appeared to be those which absorbed energy by plastic deformation and, hence, hindered void formation and/or could avoid crack propagation by deflection. Considering the response of the tested materials to cyclic loadings and the requirements of the materials specified in AISC341 Provisions could question the adequacy of these requirements for weld metals.

The effect of in-plane strain on the LaAlO3 /SrTiO3 interface is investigated. The roughness of the interface becomes larger with decreasing lattice constant. The interfacial Ti3 d xy electrons is the origin of the 2DEG formed at the interface. In-plane strain can tailor the 2DEG and induce a metal-insulator transition. The density functional theory DFT calculations are employed to investigate the effect of in-plane strain on the lattice relaxation and electronic properties of LaAlO3 /SrTiO3 interface. It is obtained that the in-plane strain influences the lattice relaxation obviously. The distortion of interfacial TiO octahedron is enhanced with the increasing of the in-plane compressive strain. The Ti3 d xy orbital at the interface is partly filled and it is the origin of the interfacial two-dimensional electron gas 2DEG. The in-plane strain can effectively modulate the carrier concentration and consequently the conductivity of the 2DEG formed at the interface.

From the experimental results, obvious improvement of corrosion fatigue strength was observed in TiN coated specimens, as compared with those without coating. The corrosion fatigue crack propagation rate observed on the surface of coated specimens was equivalent to that without coating. Fracture surface observations with a scanning-electron microscope revealed that the corrosion fatigue crack propagated from small corrosion pits formed at the base metal under the coating layer due to aqueous solution transmitted throughout the small pinhole or flaw of the coating. The causes of the improvement in the corrosion fatigue resistance of TiN coated material were elucidated that the TiN layer does not peel off from the substrate surface owing to its enough adhesion and corrosion resistance of the layer itself is more excellent than that of the substrate metal."

It is well known that fatigue behavior is influenced by residual stresses and the microstructure. By including solid-state phase transformation models in welding simulations, phase distribution can be evaluated along with their respective volumetric change and their effect on residual stresses. Thus, it enables the assessment of welding process on fatigue crack behavior by numerical methods.

The external diametral swelling rates of uranium oxides, nitrides and carbides at temperatures of up to are presented. Under similar conditions, the swelling rates are seen to increase from approximately 0.2 percent per 1020 fissions per cm3 at to 1030 percent per 1020 fissions per cm3 at. This exponential or Arrhenius relationship of swelling rates to temperature is consistent with a diffusional creep model of swelling of fuels by fission gas pressures at these temperatures. Arguments are presented which show that diffusional creep processes are required in the formation of even the smallest of gas bubbles. Mechanisms are suggested by which gas bubble growth by diffusional creep can continue to form bubbles of larger sizes without invoking difficult bubble migration processes. The kinetic nature of high-temperature fission gas swelling requires the existence of a rate process dependent upon fuel properties. It is apparent that the most probable rate-controlling processes are the coupled processes of diffusion of gas atoms to clusters and of diffusion of vacancies, primarily Schottky vacancies, to both atoms and clusters. The driving force for vacancy flow to the sites of gas atoms is initially the lattice strain energy of the individual gas atoms and subsequently the pressure of gas atoms in clusters or bubbles. This dynamic driving force is reduced by the passive, temperature-independent force called surface tension, but the former is always in excess to provide kinetic action toward the equilibrium described by surface tension."

Synthetic dyes are widely used in the majority of the large textile industry. The use of synthetic dyes can cause water pollution from sewage disposal of the textile industry. Some types of synthetic dyes contain heavy metals that are harmful to human health and can damage the environment. With increasing awareness of the current environmental problems, people begin to focus on returning back to natural dyes. These natural dyes can be extracted from various parts of plants, such as leaves, flowers, fruit, wood or stems, and roots. Papaya leaves have the potential to be used as a basic ingredient to make natural dyes due to fairly high chlorophyll content. Therefore, we took the initiative to conduct research on the production of natural dyes from papaya leaf extract. Papaya leaf extract was produced by using a solid-liquid extraction process using two different solvents, ethanol 96% and n-hexane. From the results of the study, it was found that the most optimum extract results in the extraction process was about 2.20% of the raw material of dried papaya leaves by using ethanol solvent. The prepared cotton cloth was then colored with papaya leaf extract through three simple steps, namely: mordanting, dyeing, and fixation. Fabric staining results then tested its fastness by two methods, namely the rub method and the washing method with soap. From the test results it was found that the fabric which was dyed with papaya leaf extract was not too resistant to fade from rubbing and soap washing. Therefore, further research is needed, such as using other agents during the mordanting and fixation processes."

In this study the creep deformation and rupture characteristics of a wire-drawn Cu-20%Nb composite are investigated at and compared with the results obtained from pure copper. The results show that the creep rupture strength of Cu-20%Nb is considerably higher than that for pure copper. The rupture strength of Cu-20%Nb increases up to a certain draw ratio, in contrast to the room temperature strengthening. The stress exponents n are in the range 6.68.1 for Cu-20%Nb, in comparison with 2.75 in pure copper. The increase in the creep strength and the higher stress exponent values in the Cu-20%Nb are associated with the reduction in the power law creep damage mechanism. This is due to the constraint introduced on the matrix creep flow by the niobium phase rather than the development of high threshold stress values. While the increase in the length of niobium filaments and reduction in interfilament spacing with increasing draw ratio increase the constraint on the creep flow of the matrix, they also enhance the creep damage caused by the diffusion mechanisms because of the easy diffusion paths along the niobium filaments and the reduction in the matrix gain size."

The microstructures and tensile properties of the alloys aged in different conditions were investigated. The results show that the specimen with 1.0wt.% Y additions and aged at for 15 h had the best tensile strength. The ultimate tensile strength and yield strength reached 365MPa and 352MPa, respectively. The grain refinement, the formation of the fine dispersed MgZn particles and the WMg3Zn3Y2 ternary phase may be the main reasons for the improvement. The average grain size reached to ~ 3m. The size of the fine and dispersed particles was only several nanometers and the particle number density N was very high.

A lot of crystallizations exist on the inner wall of tunnel drainage pipes in Chongqing. Tunnel support structure often bears larger load than usual because the tunnel drainage pipes are blocked easily by the crystals and the groundwater level would rise. In order to investigate what the crystals are, site investigations and laboratory tests of crystals and groundwater were completed. Some valuable results have been obtained. Firstly, the crystallizations are usually discovered in drainage pipe exits of tunnels which are under construction in Chongqing. Furthermore, the results of XRD have confirmed that the crystals are calcite. And calcite morphology could be found in most SEM images. But there are other morphologies in these images other than calcite because calcite is often influenced by some factors, such as important ions in groundwater, pH of groundwater, kinetics effect, and so on. Finally, some steps and solutions to solve blocking of tunnel drainage pipes caused by crystallization are suggested. One of the best solutions is that some special materials which could prevent crystals from being attached to pipes are coated on the inner surface of drainage pipes. The results could contribute to understand the crystallization phenomenon profoundly and help solve the similar situations of tunnel drainage pipe blocking."

Losses include convection and Stefan-Boltzmann terms; from the oxide-air surface at the focal spot these are modelled explicitly, and from the metal-oxide surfaces away from the focal spot they are approximated. We plot the rate of oxide layer growth as a function of laser power and time. The parabolic rate law in the case of a laser-induced oxidation process seems to be valid from the thickness of the oxide layer of about 0.5 m at long times and high powers, but it is not true for the very beginning of the process for the metals without native oxide layers. At lower powers the validity of the Wagner parabolic law takes place at later times of irradiation and the mechanism of oxidation is governed by the temperature gradient in the oxide film arising during scale growth.

A comprehensive summary of surface electronic properties of undoped hydrogen terminated diamond covered with adsorbates or in electrolyte solutions is given. The formation of a conductive layer at the surface is characterized using Hall effect, conductivity, contact potential difference CPM, scanning electron microscopy SEM, and cyclic voltammetry experiments. Data are from measurements on homoepitaxially grown CVD diamond films with atomically smooth hydrogen terminated surfaces. The data show that due to electron transfer from the valence band into empty states in of the electrolyte, a highly conductive surface layer is generated. Holes propagate in the layer with mobilities up to 350 cm2/Vs. The sheet hole density in this layer is in the range 1011 to 5 1012 cm2, and dependents on pH of the electrolyte or adsorbate. This has been utilized to manufacture ion sensitive field effect transistors ISFET from diamond. The drain source conductivity of single crystalline CVD diamond is pH dependent, with about 66 mV/pH, which is in reasonable agreement with the Nernst law. Due to strong coulomb repulsion between positive ions in the electrolyte and the H+-surface termination of diamond, an enlarged tunneling gap is established which prevents electronic interactions between the electrolyte and diamond. This is a virtual gate insulator of diamond Application of potentials larger than the oxidation threshold of +0.7 V pH 13 to +1.6 V pH 1 gives rise to strong leakage currents and to partial surface oxidation. In addition, the electronic interaction of diamond with redox couples is characterized using cyclic voltammetry experiments. The results are well described by the transfer doping model which accounts for the specific properties of undoped diamond immersed in electrolyte solutions are covered simply by adsorbates. In addition, numerical solutions of the Schrodinger and Poisson equations are used to show that the density of state distribution of unoccupied valence band states in case of a perfect interface would be governed by two-dimensional properties 2D. 2006 WILEY-VCHVerlag GmbH & Co.

At ejection from the mould, the casting usually springs back slightly when the elastic part of the strain is released. However, due to the low flow stress at high temperatures it is likely that the casting also has experienced some plastic deformations, meaning that the dislocation density has increased.

A new reinforced concrete foundation system is being proposed to store renewable energy through the compressed air energy storage technology. For this application, the concrete is required to resist considerable tensile strength and to have low air permeability, which is not observed in normal concrete. Therefore, this paper is proposing to use reactive powder concrete for the suggested foundation system. Reactive powder concrete RPC is obtained by introducing either micro-cementitious materials like silica fume or fine powders like crushed quartz into the concrete mixture from where coarse aggregates had been removed. RPC has low water content and dense particle packing which lead to high strength and low air permeability characteristics. This paper conducts preliminary experimental investigations on the strength and air permeability of the RPC. Two important mix design parameters are studied including water-to-binder ratio ad silica fume content. Preliminary correlations between mix design parameters and strength/air permeability are developed.

The slip-trace direction varied considerably around the hole, indicating local changes of the macroscopic slip plane. Since non-crystallographic slip occurs in FeSi under conditions used in the experiment and the crystallographic relation between the macroscopic slip plane and the tensile stress direction is known, the local tensile axes could be established.

The incipient crack tip event was analyzed using a mixed-mode displacement solution for mode-I and mode-II crack tip fields. The critical stress intensity factor for the onset of the crack tip deformation event was evaluated. A detailed description based on a von Mises atomic shear strain analysis revealed that the presence of hydrogen near a crack tip significantly inhibited the activities of emitted partial dislocations. The hydrogen locking of dislocations near a crack tip was found to facilitate the local amorphization of the crack tip, which considerably reduced the critical stress intensity factor for the onset of crack growth.

The crystallite size was determined using the Williamson-Hall method to analyze the X-ray peak broadening. It was observed that increasing the volume fraction of SiC, the mechanical alloying stages were accelerated: a finer composite powder was obtained at a shorter milling time as well as the morphology of the particles became more equiaxed. The XRD analysis showed the reduction of crystallite size of the aluminum alloy matrix with increasing milling time and that this effect is more pronounced with high volume fraction of SiC.

The chemical action and endothermic effect of ammonium polyphosphate, pentaerythritol and melamine in traditional flame retardant coating were damaged by salt spray condition, whereas the flame-retardant additives in the nano-coating demonstrated the good chemical interaction in salt spray condition. The uniformly dispersed nano-SiO2 particles could improve corrosion resistance of the coating, and hence nano-coating could remain the good fire-resistant properties even after 500 h salt spray test."

The alloy Fe75Si15B10 was formed as ribbon by melt spinning and as powder by gas-water atomization and by spark erosion in dodecane and liquid argon. The 27 m ribbon and 2030 m particles formed by spark erosion in dodecane were completely amorphous while the gas-water-atomized 2030 m particles and the particles spark eroded in liquid argon were about 50% and 80%90% crystalline respectively. The cooling rate for the ribbon was 10 s 1 and that for the 2030 m particles spark eroded in dodecane was in excess of 5 10 s 1 . The cooling rate of the particles spark eroded in liquid argon was about 5 10 s 1 ; the cooling rate for the gas-water-atomized particles was therefore between 5 10 5 and 10 s 1 . It appears that Fe75Si15B10 is not an easy alloy to obtain in the amorphous form and that the difference between the cooling rate required to form completely crystalline material and that to form completely amorphous material is less than an order of magnitude.

Membrane distillation MD has received much attention in recent years as an alternative technology for the removal of volatile compounds from industrial waters. The microporous hydrophobic membrane utilised in MD allows only vapour passing through and the process selectivity is essentially determined by the liquid-vapour equilibrium conditions existing at the liquid-membrane interface. In this study, a series of asymmetrically structured polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF hollow fibre membranes were fabricated and tested for the removal of ammonia from simulated industrial wastewater. The asymmetric membranes contain very thin skin layer with macrovoids supported underneath. Hollow fibre MD modules with membrane area of 0.06 m2 have been assembled and tested for dilute aqueous solutions containing ammonia at concentrations <1000 mg/L. The membranes were characterised in terms of porosity, thickness, hydrophobicity, water permeability, surface roughness and zeta potential. Sweep gas MD configuration was employed for all experiments and >90% ammonia removal could be achieved. The results from the MD experiments were compared and the effect of membranes characteristics was discussed."

The elastic, thermodynamic and electronic properties of LaF3 in tysonite structure have been investigated by density functional theory method within the frame of the local density approximation LDA. The calculated lattice parameters of LaF3 under zero temperature and zero pressure are in good agreement with the experimental data. The calculated elastic constants also agree well with the available experimental data and other theoretical ones. The results show that the c axis of LaF3 is slight more incompressible than the a axis. It is mechanically stable up to 21GPa. The pressure dependences of the elastic constants, Debye temperatures, Poissons ratio, sound velocity and mechanical stability of LaF3 have also been systematically investigated. Based on the quasi-harmonic approximation model, the thermodynamic properties of LaF3 have been studied. In the pressure range studied, the stability of the phonon is confirmed and its change tendency is revealed. The electronic structure calculations show that the tysonite phase of LaF3 is a direct band gap insulator with a value of 7.74eV."

In addition, nano-sized silica particles were added to reinforce electrical insulation properties and to improve the pressure sensing reliability of the composite. The addition of the surface modified silica improved better both the sensing performance and the mechanical strength than the composite containing non-modified silica particles.

To avoid catastrophic bacterial infection in prosthesis failure, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene UHMWPE, a common bearing material of artificial joints, has been formulated with antibiotics to eliminate bacteria locally at the implant site. However, the pressing issues regarding cytotoxic effects and evolution of drug resistant bacteria necessitates the development of bio-friendly bacteriostat with long bacteriostatic efficacy. Herein, tea polyphenol extracted from nature source was introduced in UHMWPE as a biogenic antimicrobial. Controlled antimicrobial activity was achieved by chemical crosslinking to regulate the release of the tea polyphenol. In addition, the crosslinking efficiency of UHMWPE blends with high loaded tea polyphenol was significantly improved in comparison to radiation crosslinking. The immobilized tea polyphenols also enhanced the oxidation stability of the UHMWPE, which is essential to prolong the service life in vivo and the storage time in vitro. The blends presented good biocompatibility, despite cell repellent on the highly crosslinked surface. Chemically crosslinked tea polyphenol/UHMWPE exhibited feasible properties for total joint implants, which is promising for clinical application. Tea polyphenol/UHMWPE was fabricated to treat periprosthetic joint infection. Controlled bacteriostasis was achieved by regulating release of tea polyphenols. The tea polyphenols enhanced oxidation stability and crosslink density of UHMWPE. The bacteriostatic mechanism was revealed by the ROS and ATP leakage of bacteria."

Single crystal Nickel-based superalloys exhibit an anomalous yield point, the yield stress increasing with temperature to a maximum at around. Here, we demonstrate in the alloy CMSX-4 at that, although there is virtually no effect of strain rate on the initial yield point, at slow strain rates a second mechanism can initiate leading to a considerable softening effect. By examining the microstructures of a series of interrupted tests, this is attributed to the initiation of stacking fault shear after the operation of a secondary slip system. Using high-resolution TEM, the dislocation structures are shown to be identical in both structure and in the segregation of Co, Cr, and W, to those observed during creep deformation of single crystal alloys, although the conformation of the dislocations and faults differs from that observed during creep. This drop in flow stress at low strain rates is not observed in the alloys TMS138A and SRR99, in the former case, the improved creep resistance of this fourth-generation alloy would require a much slower strain rate to match the creep rate achievable at this temperature."

This paper presents the results of tensile tests for lead zirconate titanate PZT/Platinum Pt thin films of 2.15 m thickness in atmospheric air at room temperature. An axial loading tester developed by the authors was used for the tests. The tester was equipped with a load cell with a maximum capacity of 0.5 N and a non-contact position measuring system based on the principle of capacitance micrometry. Furthermore, the tester was equipped with a CCD charge-coupled device system for measuring the displacement of the gage length. Specimens with three different widths 50, 100 and 150 m were fabricated to study the size width of specimen effects. The elastic moduli of the specimens with 50, 100 and 150 m width were 72.8 3.7, 75.0 1.3, 73.3 1.8 GPa, respectively. In addition, the ultimate tensile strength of the specimens with 50, 100 and 150 m width were 263.4 21.1, 238.6 4.5, 221.1 13.9 MPa, respectively. It was observed that the width of specimen has little effect on the elastic modulus of PZT/Pt thin films but has an effect on the ultimate tensile strength of PZT/Pt thin films and the ultimate tensile strength decreases as the width increases. It was assumed that the scatter in the ultimate tensile strength of 50 m width was attributed to delamination of PZT/Pt layers before the fracture in the tensile test. The 0.2% offset yield strength could not be measured because the PZT/Pt thin film is very brittle."

Ab initio calculations are performed to obtain the dispersion diagrams of several complex propagation constant modes of the structure. Analytical analysis is done for the design and interpretation of the results, which demonstrate remarkable potential for realistic use in high frequency electronics while using the LHM for possible field reconfigurations.

To understand the crack growth in massive forming and to consequentially avoid crack growth in workpieces, it is necessary to investigate its dependence on the crack depth and thus on the state of hydrostatic stress. Prior work shows that the crack opening displacement COD for shallow cracked tension specimens with low stress triaxiality is twice as high as for deep cracked specimens with high stress triaxiality. This work examines the crack growth in compression specimens with pre-cracked cylindrical upsetting samples. The compression samples were cut in the stress symmetry plane in order to observe crack initiation and crack growth by a single specimen technique. In this way it is possible to observe blunting, crack initiation and crack growth inside the upsetting specimens. The resulting COD does not differ significantly from the values achieved in tension samples with short surface cracks."

The AlCuMg alloy is a precipitation-strengthening alloy, which is traditionally dissolving lots of secondary phase and precipitating in subsequent aging process, thus having been applied to aerospace and automobile industry due to its low density and high strength. However, the high temperature and long operating time needed for the dissolution of secondary phase consume numerous energy. In this work, rapid dissolution of secondary phase in cold-rolling AlCuMg alloy was achieved by coupling treatment of thermal field and pulsed electric current. The energy consumption for dissolving secondary phasewas reduced from operating 1h to operating several minutes. Therefore, the coupling treatment of thermal field and pulsed electric current significantly improves the dissolving rate and decreases the energy consumption."

First-principles pseudopotential calculations were performed to investigate atomic and electronic structures of titanium Ti dopants in alumina Al2O3. It was found that a substitutional Ti3+ defect induced an extra level occupied by one electron within the band gap of Al2O3. When two or more substitutional Ti3+ defects were located closely to each other, the defect-induced levels exhibited strong bonding interactions, and their formation energies decreased with increasing numbers of Ti3+ defects. This indicates that association and clustering of substitutional Ti3+ defects in Al2O3 can take place due to the interaction of the defect-induced levels."

A new criterion for shear band formation in metallic glasses is proposed based on the shear plane criterion proposed by Packard and Schuh 1. This modified shear plane MSP criterion suggests that a shear band is not initiated randomly throughout the entire material under stress but is initiated at the physical boundaries or defects and at locations where the highest normal stress modified maximum shear stress occurs. Moreover, the same as in the shear plan criterion, the shear stress all over the shear band should exceed the shear yield strength of the material. For a complete shear band to form, both requirements need to be fulfilled. The shear yield strength of the material is represented by the shear stress of the point at which the shear band stops. The new criterion agrees very well with experimental results in both the determination of the shear yield strength and the shear band path. C2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

With increasing aging time, the hydroxyl ions existing in the anatase lattice decreased, and so the oxygen vacancy concentration produced after calcination decreased. Consequently, increasing aging time during sintering lowered the crystallite growth rate of anatase. The densification of the TiO2 powders was dependent upon the aging time which shifted the anataserutile ar-TiO2 phase transformation to higher temperature and lowered the crystallite growth rate during sintering."

This paper evaluates the residual safety of isolated T-joists with severe corrosion for the two extreme cases of boundary conditions, simply supported and fixed-ended, in order to help in making decisions about the magnitude of the necessary intervention. When the T-joist is part of a complete slab, the boundary conditions will be in an intermediate situation between these two extreme cases, so that it is possible to assess the safety with respect to its degree of embedding. The research is conducted for the cases of healthy T-joist, T-joist with complete corrosion of the lower reinforcement, and repaired T-joists with a variable number of CFRP sheets. This work is based on the ACI 318 load test to maintain a structure in use and proposes a Load Factor LF, which estimates the safety reserve. The simply supported T-joists specimens with severe corrosion do not meet the Load Factor or ACI 318 criteria, even with a large number of CFRP sheets. On the other hand, fixed-ended cases can be kept in use despite corrosion by applying light CFRP strengthening, and with four sheets the initial safety is restored."
