You are an AI assisting an active learning system.

You are given {k} abstracts with their corresponding keywords. 
You should output a number between 1 and {k} to identify the abstract where the keywords fit least considering the rules below.

The model extracts keywords in a normalizing fashion. Sometimes, there are no exact matches but the meaning is the same.
This shouldn't influence your decision.

What is important, however, is that there are no hallucinations or missed important keywords.
