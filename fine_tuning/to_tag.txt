Effect of Ground Waste Concrete Powder on Cement Properties. The paste/mortar
attached to the recycled aggregate decreases the quality of the aggregate and
needs to be stripped. The stripped paste/mortar is roughly 20% to 50% in waste
concrete, but relevant research is very limited. In this paper, the effects of
ground waste concrete GWC powder, coming from the attached paste/mortar, on
water demand for normal consistency, setting time, fluidity, and compressive
strength of cement were analyzed. The results show that the 20% of GWC powder by
the mass of binder has little effect on the above properties and can prepare C20
concrete; when the sand made by waste red clay brick WRB replaces 20% of river
sand, the strength of the concrete is increased by 17% compared with that
without WRB sand.

Hydrogen content in titanium and a titaniumzirconium alloy after acid etching.
Dental implant alloys made from titanium and zirconium are known for their high
mechanical strength, fracture toughness and corrosion resistance in comparison
with commercially pure titanium. The aim of the study was to investigate
possible differences in the surface chemistry and/or surface topography of
titanium and titanium-zirconium surfaces after sand blasting and acid etching.
The two surfaces were compared by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, secondary
ion mass spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and profilometry. The 1.9
times greater surface hydrogen concentration of titanium zirconium compared to
titanium was found to be the major difference between the two materials.
Zirconium appeared to enhance hydride formation on titanium alloys when etched
in acid. Surface topography revealed significant differences on the micro and
nanoscale. Surface roughness was increased significantly p<0.01 on the titanium-
zirconium alloy. High-resolution images showed nanostructures only present on
titanium zirconium.

Dynamic nanoindentation of articular porcine cartilage. Articular cartilage is a
poroelastic biphasic material with a complex deformation behavior, which can be
considered elasticviscoelastic. In this article, articular porcine cartilage is
tested in vitro using dynamic nanoindentation and is analyzed using the
frequency domain. The testing and data analysis are presented as a function of
the strain rate and frequency, which allows for the results to be compared for
various load amplitudes over the same frequency range. In addition, a new
approach to correct the contact area during dynamic nanoindentation is presented
and the effects of sample freezing on the mechanical properties are also
discussed.

Microstructure and mechanical properties of AZ91D magnesium alloy prepared by
compound extrusion. Based on conventional extrusion and equal channel angular
extrusion ECAE, a new severe plastic deformation SPD method called compound
extrusion is developed to fabricate fine-grained AZ91D magnesium alloys. The
fine grain size of 6m is obtained as the accumulated strain increased to 9.146.
The AZ91D alloy treated by compound extrusion exhibits good mechanical
properties, with a yield strength of 202.2MPa, a tensile strength of 323.1MPa
and an elongation to fracture of 14.8%. The good mechanical properties of AZ91D
alloy treated by compound extrusion are due to grain refinement and to the
homogeneous distribution of intermetallic particles. The success in development
of compound extrusion proves that compound extrusion can offer a good
opportunity for the development of good mechanical properties of as-cast
magnesium alloys.

Studies on the Influence of Drying Shrinkage Test Procedure, Specimen Geometry,
and Boundary Conditions on Free Shrinkage. Although considerable progress has
been made in enhancing the use and interpretation of free ring shrinkage test,
little is known about the impact of the test procedure, the specimen geometry,
the surface area-to-volume S/V ratio exposed to drying, and the boundary
conditions sealing configuration on the measured shrinkage. This paper
highlights recent findings illustrating the influence of the test procedure, the
S/V ratio exposed to drying, the geometry of specimen, and the boundary
conditions. A series of experimental results are presented from free shrinkage
on ring test specimens to illustrate that the test procedure can significantly
influence the measured free shrinkage. A second series of experimental results
are presented from specimens with different geometries and S/V ratio exposed to
drying to illustrate that drying shrinkage is dependent on both the specimen
geometry and the surface exposed to drying. Test results further show that, even
for the same S/V ratio exposed to drying, shrinkage is strongly dependent on the
specimens geometry and boundary conditions.

Ultrathin 2D bismuth oxychloride nanosheets as novel catalytic interfaces for
detection of biomolecules. TOC graphic : Schematic representation of BiOCl
modified microchip behavior for the detection of uric acid. Highly thin bismuth
oxychloride nanosheets are grown as the catalytic interfaces to design a
microchip based sensor platform. The interface morphology consists of uniform
square shaped nanosheets, 34 nm in height. The designed microchips demonstrate
efficient detection of bioanalytes in blood. We introduce highly stable 2D
layered bismuth oxychloride nanosheets as the catalytic interfaces to bind
important biomedical analytes. Transmission electron and atomic force microscopy
revealed the prepared nanosheets possess perfect square morphology possessing
average lateral size of 200 nm, and thickness around 34 nm. We specifically
demonstrated characteristics for the binding of uric acid. When these sheets
were employed to functionalize microchips, the limit of detection was achieved
as low as 0.38 M S/N = 3. We further investigated that the modified devices
determined successfully uric acid in human blood sample. This is the first study
where ultrathin nanostructures are integrated with microchips. This work
establishes the potential of ultrathin graphene-like nanosheets to design smart

Thermo-hydrogen refinement of microstructure to improve mechanical properties of
Ti6Al4V fabricated via laser powder bed fusion. This paper describes the main
results from an investigation into the consequences of thermo-hydrogen
refinement of microstructure THRM after laser powder bed fusion LPBF of Ti6Al4V
on the evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties using a set of
experimental techniques. Porosity fraction, grain structure, phases, and
crystallographic texture per phase are characterized using micro X-ray computed
tomography, microscopy, and neutron diffraction. A hierarchical structure of
acicular -phase morphology formed inside the prior grains by fast cooling during
LPBF transforms into fine-grained globular microstructure by THRM, which
facilitates homogeneous nucleation and growth of the low temperature phase with
some retained phase. Moreover, hydrogenated material during THRM has low
activation energy for diffusion, which in conjunction with the surface energy of
pores causes densification of the material, thereby closing porosity formed
during LPBF. Such significant microstructural changes induced by the THRM
treatment cause brittle material created by LPBF to become ductile.
Significantly, the strength and ductility produced by THRM exceed the minimums
set forth by the ASTM B348 standard for Ti-6Al-4V. Moreover, the treatment
improves fatigue strength of the material. In particular, it improves the
endurance limit and reduces the scatter in the measured fatigue strength data.
Performance characteristics of the material can be further optimized for
specific application requirements by tailoring microstructures using the LPBF
and THRM processes.

Tensile behavior of hybrid epoxy composite laminate containing carbon and basalt
fibers. This paper investigated the effect of the incorporation of basalt fibers
on the tensile properties of carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy laminates
manufactured by vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding. The purpose of this
research was to design a carbon-basalt/epoxy hybrid composite material that is
of low cost in production, is lightweight, and has good strength and stiffness.
The tensile strength and stiffness of the hybrid laminates demonstrated a
steady, linear decrease with an increase in basalt fiber content, but the
fracture strain gradually increased together with the increase in the basalt
layer content. In this study, the incorporation of basalt fibers into the carbon
fiber-reinforced polymer CFRP showed lower tensile strength than CFRP but has
higher tensile strain. Furthermore, we found that the arrangement and
enhancement of basalt fiber into the CFRP significantly influence the mechanical
properties of interply hybrid composites.

The Effects of Ozone Bleaching and Ozone Desizing Method on Whiteness and Water
Absorption of 100% Cotton Terry Fabrics. In this study, the effects of ozone
desizing and bleaching on the hydrophilicity and whiteness of terry fabrics were
investigated. The results were compared with those obtained after conventional
desizing and bleaching hydrogen peroxide bleaching. The test samples contain two
side piled woven terry cloths of four different areal weights. The ozone
desizing and bleaching process was carried out at fixed PH values 6 in four
different ozonation times and two different ozone doses. The rate of water
pickup in fabrics was 60%. It has been determined that as ozonation time and the
ozone dose increase, the degree of whiteness and water absorption of the terry
fabric increases. However, the increase in the ozonation time did not cause a
significant change in the low ozone doses; the change in the ozonation time at
high ozone doses is causing a marked change in the investigated properties of
the towel fabric. The degree of hydrophilicity and whiteness achieved after
ozonation was found to be close to the results obtained in conventional
bleaching. However it was seen that although acceptable water absorbency was
obtained by the ozone desizing method, these values were lower than those of the
conventional desizing method. Ozone bleaching and desizing do not require the
consumption of water, the consumption of heat energy, and the use of any
chemical additive that harms the environment with its wastes.a result, owing to
ecofriendly, saving energy and acceptable fabric properties with regard to
whiteness and absorptivity, ozone bleaching can be applied instead of the
conventional bleaching and desizing method.

Origin and development of residual stresses in the NiNiO system: in-situ studies
at high temperature by X-ray diffraction. In order to characterize the
respective importance of the growth stresses, thermal stresses and stress
relaxation developed in oxide scales, two high temperature chambers for X-ray
diffraction were designed, allowing us to determine the stresses in both the
oxide and the substrate with the sin2 technique, at high temperatures or room
temperature and during heating-cooling sequences. It was applied to NiNiO. At
room temperature after oxidation, NiO is subjected to compressive stresses whose
level depends on the substrate thickness and on the oxidation time and
temperature. In the substrate, compressive stresses are mainly due to internal
oxidation. During oxidation at, the oxide scale is subjected to slight tensile
stresses which can be due partially to anionic diffusion, internal oxidation or
the heating process. During heating-cooling sequences, the stresses in the scale
decrease with increasing temperature and become negligible when the oxidation
temperature is reached. The reversibility of the stress-temperature curve
indicates that no stress relaxation occurs. The stresses found at room
temperature are due only to thermal stresses and fit well the theoretical
calculation of thermal stresses in NiO scale based on the newly determined
thermal expansion coefficients of Ni and NiO. All these results show that the
stresses found at room temperature are mainly generated during cooling and that
the effect of the Pilling-Bedworth ratio or of factors playing a role during
isothermal growth is negligible.

Multilayer graphene and -Si3N4 whisker-reinforced porous Si3N4 ceramics by spark
plasma incomplete sintering. Combining the advantages of spark plasma sintering
SPS and incomplete sintering IS in preparation of Si3N4 ceramics, the spark
plasma incomplete sintering SPIS was presented to fabricate porous Si3N4
ceramics. Considering balancing the contradictory relationship between the
porosity and toughness, 1 wt% multilayer graphene MLG was incorporated into
porous Si3N4 ceramics. Meanwhile, for the sake of compensating for the decrease
in the hardness of porous Si3N4 ceramics induced by MLG, 08 wt% -Si3N4 whisker
-Si3N4 w were synergistically added. The element distribution, phase
constitutions and microstructures of MLG/-Si3N4 w -reinforced porous Si3N4
ceramics were characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy EDS, x-rays
diffraction XRD and scanning electron microscope SEM. The effects of -Si3N4 w
content on porosity, hardness and fracture toughness of porous Si3N4 -based
ceramics were analyzed. Results indicated that the porosity of porous Si3N4
-based ceramics reached 21%, and then decreased significantly after the -Si3N4 w
content exceeded 4 wt%. The hardness of porous Si3N4 -based ceramics obtained
the maximum value 2.81 GPa when - Si3N4 w was added 8 wt%, which was 31.92%
higher than monolithic porous Si3N4 ceramic. The mass transfer, diffusion and
fusion induced by -Si3N4 w were considered to be the main responsible for the
increase of hardness. The fracture toughness of specimen with 1 wt% MLG and 4
wt% -Si3N4 w was advanced to 3.14 MPa m 1/2/ , which was 15.44% higher than
monolithic porous Si3N4 ceramic. The markedly enhanced of the fracture toughness
was attributed to the synergistic effects of crack deflection, pull-out and
bridging resulted by MLG/-Si3N4 w . Spark plasma incomplete sintering was
proposed to fabricate porous Si3N4 ceramics. MLG/-Si3N4 w were doped into porous
Si3N4 ceramics to advance its strength. MLG/-Si3N4 w -enhanced Si3N4 ceramics
with a porosity of 21% were prepared at. Hardness of MLG/-Si3N4 w -reinforced
porous Si3N4 ceramics reached 2.81 GPa. Fracture toughness of porous Si3N4

partly crystallized owing to the rise in temperature during spraying, whereas
the layer on the copper substrate, 1.5 mm thick, remained amorphous. The maximum

Scarf Repair of Composite Laminates. The use of composite materials, such as
carbon-fiber reinforced plastic CFRP composites, aero- structures has led to an
increased need of advanced assembly joining and repair technologies. Adhesive
bonded repairs as an alternative to recover full or part of initial strength
were investigated. Tests were conducted with the objective of evaluating the
effectiveness of techniques used for repairing damage fiber reinforced laminated
composites. Failure loads and failure modes were generated and compared with the
following parameters: scarf angles, roughness of grind tool and number of
external plies. Results showed that scarf angle was the critical parameter and
the largest tensile strength was observed with the smallest scarf angle.
Besides, the use of external plies at the outer surface could not increase the
repairs efficiency for large scarf angle. Preparing the repair surfaces by
sanding them with a sander ranging from 60 to 100 grit number had significant
effect on the failure load. These results allowed the proposal of design
principles for repairing CFRP structures.

Integration of -cyclodextrin into graphene quantum dot nano-structure and its
application towards detection of Vitamin C at physiological pH: A new
electrochemical approach. For the first time, -Cyclodextrin -CD attachment to
graphene quantum dot GQD structure was performed using simultaneous
electrodeposition of GQD and -CD on the surface of glassy carbon electrode GCE.
Cyclic voltammetry at potential range -1.0 to 1.0V from mixture of GQD and -CD
produced a well-defined -CD-GQD deposited on the surface of glassy carbon
electrode. -CD-GQD modified GCE was used as a new electrocatalytical
nanocomposite towards electrooxidation of Vitamin C as sample analyte. The
synergistic effects and the catalytic activity of the -CD-GQD modified GCE were
investigated by cyclic voltammetry CV, differential pulse voltammetry DPV
chronoamperometry CA and square wave voltammetry SWV. The process of oxidation
involved and its kinetics were established by using cyclic voltammetry,
chronoamperometry techniques. It has been found that in the course of an anodic
potential sweep the electro-oxidation of Vitamin C is catalyzed by synergetic
effect of -CD and GQD through a mediated electron transfer mechanism. Therefore,
-CD-GQDs promote the rate of oxidation by increasing the peak current. The
cyclic voltammetric results indicate that -CD-GQDs-GCE can remarkably enhance
electroactivity towards the oxidation of Vitamin C in buffer solution. We have
illustrated that the as-obtained -CD-GQDs-GCE exhibited a much higher
electrocatalytical behavior thanfor the electrooxidation and detection of
Vitamin C which was about two fold higher than for The electrochemical behavior
was further exploited as detection scheme for the Vitamin C electrooxidation by
square wave voltammetry.

High-temperature mechanical properties of 2024 Al matrix nanocomposite
reinforced by TiC network architecture. In this work, 2024 Al matrix composite
reinforced by 1.5 wt% in-situ synthesized TiC nanoparticles has been fabricated
by casting method. It was found that TiC nanoparticles were distributed along
-Al grain boundaries, which formed network architecture, and average cell size
of the TiC network was 48m. The 20241.5TiC nanocomposite exhibited enhanced
mechanical properties compared to 2024 base alloy. The ultimate tensile strength
at was increased from 105MPa to 151MPa, with elongation reasonably decreasing
from 9.5% to 7.1%. It was observed that the presence of the TiC network
transformed deformation behavior of -Al matrix from local deformation to overall
deformation during tensile test at high temperature. This enhanced strength of
the 20241.5TiC, which contributed to ~84% increase in yield strength
theoretically. Accordingly, a new strengthening mechanism named as constraint
strengthening has been put forward in this paper. This principle was supposed to
be applicable for microstructure design of other alloys and composites. In
addition, the circle network was shifted to be oval one during deformation, but
the interconnectivity has not been broken. This produced reasonably high
ductility for the 20241.5TiC nanocomposite.

Soybean-modified polyamide-6 mats as a long-term cutaneous wound covering.
Engineered skin coverings have been adopted clinically to support extensive and
deep wounds that result in fewer healthy skin remaining and therefore take
longer to heal. Nonetheless, these biomaterials demand intensive labor and an
expensive final cost. In comparison to conventional bandages, which do not meet
all the requirements of wound care, electrospun fiber mats could potentially
provide an excellent environment for healing. In this work, we developed two
nanostructured scaffolds based on polyamide-6 PA-6 to be tested as a wound
covering in a rat model of full-thickness incisional wound healing. The central
idea was to create a bioconstruct that is simple to implement and biologically
safe, with a high survival rate, which provides physical support and biological
recognition for new functional tissues. An unmodified PA-6 and a soybean-
modified PA-6 were employed as nanofibrillar matrices in this study. The
biomaterials showed a dimensional homology to natural extracellular matrix
components and neither in vitro toxicity nor in vivo side effects. Both
polymeric scaffolds were resistant to the sterilization process and could
promote the attachment of 3T3 fibroblast cells, besides successfully
incorporating the growth factor PDGF-BB, which had its bioactivity extended for
up to 12 h under simulated conditions. The modification of PA-6 chains with a
fatty acid derivative increased the scaffold's surface free energy, favoring
cell proliferation, collagen formation, and ECM secretion. These results confirm
the potential of these materials as a topical dermal covering for skin
regeneration.

First-principles study on electronic and optical properties of transparent
conducting oxide CuBO2. In this work we study the electronic and optical
properties of the new p-type transparent conducting oxide CuBO2. Firstly, after
optimizing its lattice parameters, a band structure is calculated by density
functional theory with local density approximation DFT-LDA, on-site Coulomb
interaction LDA+U, quasi-particle approximation GWA and Tran and Blahas modified
BeckeJohnson exchangecorrelation potentials TB09. Both LDA+U and G0W0
calculations are accurate for the indirect band gap, but fail for the direct
one. While QPscGW calculations do perturbative corrections to both G0W0 indirect
and direct band gap in the same amount, it is leading to an overestimation of
the indirect band gap and an underestimation of the direct one at the same time.
Besides, the indirect and direct band gap of the optimized lattice parameters
are calculated by ABINIT code with TB09 exchange functional and they are
underestimated by about 1% and 17%, respectively. For comparison purposes with
the experimental values, the band structure is also calculated by ELK code with
TB09 and with a minuscule amount of charge removed from its primitive unit cell.
With a charge removal by 0.86 both band gaps are very close to the experimental
values, with an error of about 0.2% for the indirect band gap and about 0.9% for
the direct one. Finally, the dielectric function and optical conductivity of the
bulk CuBO2 are calculated by random phase approximation RPA and time-dependent
density functional theory TDDFT on top of the TB09 electronic structure.

Thermodynamics Calculation of Extra Mn Addition in the Recycling of
AlSiCuAluminium Alloys. Iron contamination from scrapped materials is always a
problem in producing high quality secondary aluminium alloys. Consequently, the
iron removal during recycling of aluminium alloys is essential and important in
industrial practice. This work aims to study the effect of extra Mn addition on
the effectiveness and efficiency of iron removal during recycling. The
thermodynamics assessment was carried out for AlSiCu alloys to find out the
variation of balanced iron and manganese in the liquid melt and in the sediment
solid Fe-rich intermetallics with different levels of extra Mn addition. The
effect of alloy composition and processing temperatures was investigated. The
findings help to understand the capability and fundamentals of iron removal in
aluminium alloys.

Effect of magnesium on mechanical properties of alumina-fiber-reinforced
aluminum matrix composites formed by pressure infiltration casting. AlAl2O3
composites containing 0.48%6.8% Mg in the matrix alloys have been fabricated by
pressure infiltration casting. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy
and image analysis were used to examine and to analyze the details of the
microstructure and the fracture surface. Tensils tests were utilized to evaluate
the mechanical properties. The addition of magnesium was found to improve the
infiltration and to decrease the porosity of the composites. The tensile
strength of the composites increased with increased magnesium content, while
elongation remained almost constant 10%.

Gaussian distribution in current-conduction mechanism of Ni/PtSchottky contacts
on wide bandgap AlInGaN quaternary alloy. The current-conduction mechanisms of
the as-deposited and annealed at Ni/PtSchottky contacts on AlInGaN quaternary
alloy have been investigated in the temperature range of. The zero-bias barrier
height BHB0 and ideality factor n of them were evaluated using thermionic
emission TE theory. The B0 and n values calculated from the IV characteristics
show a strong temperature dependence. Such behavior of B0 and n is attributed to
Schottky barrier inhomogeneities. Therefore, both the B0 vs n and B0 vs q/2kT
plots were drawn to obtain evidence on the Gaussian distribution GD of the
barrier height at the metal/semiconductor interface. These plots show two
different linear parts at low and intermediate temperatures for as-deposited and
annealed Schottky contacts. Thus, the mean value of B0 and standard deviation 0
was calculated from the linear parts of the B0 vs q/kT plots for both samples.
The values of the effective Richardson constant A and mean BH were obtained from
the modified Richardson plots which included the effect of barrier
inhomogeneity. These values of Richardson constant and barrier height for as-
deposited contacts were found to be 19.9Acm2K2 and 0.59eV, respectively, at low
temperature, but 43.3Acm2K2 and 1.32eV, respectively, at intermediate

annealed contacts were found to be 19.6Acm2K2 and 0.37eV, respectively, at low
temperature, but 42.9Acm2K2 and 1.54eV, respectively, at intermediate
temperatures. It is clear that the value of the Richardson constant obtained for
as-deposited and annealed samples by using double-GD for intermediate
temperatures is close to the theoretical value of AlInGaN =44.7Acm2K2.
Therefore, IV-T characteristics for the as-deposited and annealed Schottky

Radiation effects in silicon detectors processed on carbon and oxygen-rich
substrates. Radiation hardness results of silicon detectors fabricated on bulk
float-zone FZ material enriched either by carbon or by oxygen are reported. The
detectors were irradiated by nuclear reactor neutrons, by 24GeV/ c protons and
by 192MeV pions. It has been shown that the leakage current increases with
fluence equally in all silicon detectors under study, regardless of the oxygen
or carbon concentrations. The variations in the space-charge density were found
to be very different in the oxygen and carbon-enriched materials in the case of
irradiation by charged particles, yet rather similar in case of neutrons.

Effect of Surface Roughness on the Adhesion of Elastomers to Hard Surfaces. The
work presented started with the aim of trying to explain why clean smooth
surfaces of materials such as metals brought gently into contact show no
adhesion. The observation by Johnson Kendall &amp; Roberts of adhesion between
smooth surfaces of an elastomeric hemisphere and a rigid substrate suggested a
model contact system with which the effect of surface roughness could be
investigated experimentally. Moreover the Johnson-Kendal-Roberts JKR contact
theory could be used to predict the effect of roughness on adhesion. The
observations and predictions obtained are compared, and the implications for the
contact of two rigid materials outlined. The limitations of the validity of the
predictions are mentioned. Further studies of the adhesion to rough surfaces, in
particular the phenomenon of enhanced adhesion at low roughness, will be
discussed. Finally, more recent theoretical work is briefly referred to.

The electrical characteristics of Ni/n-GaSbSchottky diode. The junction
characteristics of the Ni/n-GaSbSchottky diode were discussed on the basis of
temperature-dependent currentvoltage IV-T measurements. The barrier height and
ideality factor assuming thermionic emission TE theory shows strong temperature
dependence. The Schottky barrier increases from 0.28 to 0.48eV as the measured
temperature increases from 173 to, while the ideality decreases from 1.82 to
1.15. The series resistance also increases as the measured temperature decreases
due to the decrease of carrier concentration. The barrier height is plotted
against q/2kT to obtain evidence of the Gaussian distribution of the barrier
heights and because of barrier height inhomogeneities. From this plot, the mean
barrier height and standard deviation at zero bias for as-deposited Ni/n-GaSb
diode were 0.66eV and 0.107V, respectively. Furthermore, from a modified
Richardson plot, ln J s / T 2 q 2 S02 / 2 k 2 T 2 versus 1000/T, the activation

Proper pH value enhances giant magneto-impedance effect of FINEMET/rGO composite
ribbons by electroless plating. Electromagnetic interaction in composite
structure materials has been a crucial physical mechanism to optimize magnetic
property of magnetic devices. In this paper, the composite ribbons of FINEMET
coated with reduced graphene oxide rGO were successfully prepared by electroless
plating method at different pH values. The structure, morphology and magnetic
properties of the FINEMET/rGO composite ribbons were characterized by X-Ray
diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, giant magneto-
impedance GMI analysis and vibrating sample magnetometer techniques,
respectively. The resultsshowed that the peak position field of composite ribbon
first decreases and then increases with the variation of pH value, which
indicated that there may be existed electromagnetic interaction and stress
between rGO and the FINEMET ribbon. The electromagnetic interaction may lead to
the redistribution of current density and the change of skin depth. An
interpretation in terms of electromagnetic interaction between rGO and FINEMET
ribbon was proposed, which provided a new perspective for analyzing the
variation in GMI effect of composite materials.

Barrier Hopping model at high temperatures. From dc conductance analysis,
conduction seems to be thermally activated, suggesting the existence of
semiconductor process. Detailed investigation of impedance data revealed the
non-Debye nature of the relaxation processes in the sample. In addition,
Dielectric constant curves were applied to examine the relaxation dynamics of
charge carriers. In fact, the Debye-like relaxation was performed on the basis

Ion Tracks in Polymers. Ion tracks were discovered by Young in 1958 1, as he
examined etch pits in fission-fragment-irradiated LiF by means of scanning
electron microscopy. In1959 , Silk and Barnes 2 observed latent fission-fragment
tracks in mica in the transmission electron microscope. These discoveries
prompted the development of research on ion tracks until now, including track-
etching techniques for particle detection and identification, and their use in
several areas of science and technology such as geochronology and radiation
dosimetry 3, 4. In these applications, mostly natural minerals and synthetic
polymers have served as ion-track detectors. At the same time, inorganic and
polymeric track membranes, produced by ion irradiation and subsequent etching,
have found applications in microfiltration 5 and gas-separation 6 technologies.
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that track etching can be useful in
lithography 7, and that microcomponents for electronic and mechanical devices
can be fabricated by track replications 810. Some of these applications will be

Mechanical Surface Treatment Technologies for Improving HCFStrength and Surface
Roughness of Blisk-Rotors. The manufacturing of electron beam welded blade
integrated disk blisk rotors sets new demands on mechanical surface treatment
technologies. High durability and high efficiency of the blades are in general
strict requirements for the component and have ideally to be increased by a
mechanical surface treatment. The high complex 3D shape of the blades and the
need to treat the blades on the rotor caused by a post weld heat treatment are
additional challenges to solve. Limited clearance between the blades and low
space between the individual blisks increase as well the requirements on the
technology. Conventional technologies reach their limits and have to be
improved. This paper gives an insight into the capabilities of different
mechanical surface treatments regarding the treatment of blades on blisk-rotors.
Compared with the benchmark shot peening, surface roughness, residual stress
depth distribution and high cycle fatigue HCF are investigated on deep rolled
and vibropeened specimen. Assets and drawbacks are shown and discussed.

Strain rate and orientation-dependent strain hardening of Mg9LiAl using crystal
plasticity. A crystal plasticity finite element model was proposed considering
slip and twinning interactions. The grain morphology and crystallographic
orientations were introduced into the model to describe the microstructure of
duplex polycrystalline Mg9LiAl. The activation of the slip systems and the
strain localisation with respect to initial grain orientations were
investigated. In addition, the effects of phase distributions and volume
fractions on the macroscopic responses and on strain hardening rates were
analysed. The results show that the strain hardening is rate-dependent but the
texture is less sensitive to strain rate. The distribution of a phase and its
volume fraction play primary roles in governing the mechanical response.

Utilization of sugarcane bagasse ash in concrete as partial replacement of
cement. This research addresses the suitability of sugarcane bagasse ash SCBA in
concrete used as partial cement replacement. Two grades of concrete M15 and M20
were used for the experimental analysis. The cement was partially replaced by
SCBA at 0%, 5%, and 10%, by weight in normal strength concrete NSC. The
innovative part of this study is to consider two grades of concrete mixes to
evaluate the performance of concrete while cement is replaced by sugarcane
bagasse ash. The cylindrical specimens having size 150 mm 300 mm were used and
tested after curing period of 7, 14 and 28 days. It was observed through the
experimental work that the compressive strength increases with incorporating
SCBA in concrete. Results indicated that the use of SCBA in concrete M20 at 5%
increased the average amount of compressive strength by 12% as compared to the
normal strength concrete. The outcome of this work indicates that maximum
strength of concrete could be attained at 5% replacement of cement with SCBA.
Furthermore, the SCBA also gives compatible slump values which increase the
workability of concrete.

vol.% SiC particulates and in the corresponding unreinforced alloy. The
composite exhibited better fatigue crack growth resistance than the monolithic
alloy in the three environments, although the differences decreased as the crack
growth rate increased. The differences in the fatigue crack growth rates between
the two materials were attributed to the higher closure levels in the composite,
induced by its smaller crack-opening displacements. The presence of SiC
particulates did not modify the susceptibility of this Al alloy to corrosion
fatigue, the crack growth rates being maxima in salt water and minima in high
vacuum.

Fatigue failure under stress below fatigue limit - From the viewpoint of
internal stress.. The stress applied to a specimen does not fully act to deform
material. The effective stress which actually acts on dislocations can be
related to the internal stress of material. The origin of internal stress and
thus effective stress has been discussed here by means of a dislocation model,
concluding that internal stress depends on the dislocation structure. Based on
this conclusion, fatigue tests were carried out and the following results were
obtained:1 The behavior of internal stress in the fatigue process showed a clear
difference between the over-stressed and the under-stressed conditions.2 The
fatigue failure occurred under many-fold multiple repeated stress in two stress
levels below the fatigue limit. Such fracture was attributed to the instability
of internal stress.3 The concept of internal stress and effective stress is
useful to the comprehensive understanding of fatigue phenomenon.

The strength of glass fibre reinforcement after exposure to elevated composite
processing temperatures. The results of a study on the properties of glass
fibres after thermal conditioning at typical engineering thermoplastic
processing temperatures are presented. The mechanical performance of rovings and
single fibres of well-defined silane- and water-sized E-glass fibre samples was
investigated at room temperature after thermal conditioning at temperatures up
to. Thermal conditioning for 15 min led to strength degradation of >50 % at
higher temperatures. The tensile strength of silane-coated fibres was relatively
stable up to but exhibited a precipitous drop at higher conditioning
temperatures. The water-sized fibres exhibited an approximately linear decrease
in strength with increasing conditioning temperature. The strength distribution
of the water-sized fibres could be well represented by a unimodal three-
parameter Weibull distribution. The strength distributions of the sized fibres
were more complicated and required the use of a bimodal Weibull distribution.
The results are discussed in terms of the changes in surface coating and bulk
glass structure during heat conditioning.

A compare of electrical characteristics in Al/p-Si MS and Al/C20H12/p-Si MPS
type diodes using currentvoltage 4+ and capacitancevoltage CV measurements. In
this study, both the metal-semiconductor MS and metal-polymer-semiconductor MPS,
Al/C20H12/p-Si, type Schottky barrier diodeswere fabricated using spin coating
method and they were called as D1 and D2 diodes, respectively. Their electrical
characterization have been investigated and compared using the forward and
reverse bias IV and CV measurements at room temperature. The main electrical
parameters such as ideality factor n, reverse saturation current Io, zero-bias
barrier height Bo, seriesand shunt Rsh resistances, energy dependent profile of
interface states Nss, the doping concentration of acceptor atoms NA and
depletion layer width WD were determined and compared each other and literature.
The rectifying ratio RR and leakage current IR at 3V were found as 2.06103,
1.61106A and 15.7103, 2.75107A for D1 and D2, respectively. Similarly, theand
Rsh values of these diodes were found as 544, 10.7M and 716 and 1.83M using Ohms
Law, respectively. In addition, energy and voltage dependent profiles of Nss
were obtained using the forward bias IV data by taking into account voltage
dependent effective barrier height e and n and low-high frequency capacitance
CLFCHF methods, respectively. The obtained value of Nss for D2 MPS diode at
about the mid-gap of Si is about two times lower than D1 MS type diode.
Experimental results confirmed that the performance in MPS type SBD is
considerably high according to MS diode in the respect of lower values of
Nss,and Io and higher values of RR and Rsh.

Application of crystalline silicon solar cells in photovoltaic modules. Purpose:
The aim of the paper is to determinate basic electrical properties of solar
cells, made of them photovoltaic module and analysis of its main electrical
parameters. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, several methods were
used: current voltage characteristic to determinate basic electrical properties
of 36 monocrystalline silicon solar cells, soft soldering technique to bond
solar cells . Photovoltaic module was produced from 31 solar cells with the
largest short-circuit current, which were joined in series. Findings: In order
to obtain a device producing an electrical current with a higher current and
voltage level, solar cells were connected in a photovoltaic module and then
protected from damages derived from external factors. In series connection solar
cell with the lowest current determines the current flowing in the PV module.
Taking this fact into account the analysis of photovoltaic module construction
was performed. Practical implications: Because of low operating cost and
simplicity of photovoltaic installation, photovoltaic technology is perfectly
suitable for supplying objects which are beyond powers network range as well as
connected to it. In many cases, they are less costly option than a direct
extension of the power network. Originality/value: Protecting the environment
from degradation due to pollution, which has source in conventional power
industry, as well as diminishing resources of fossil fuels, tend to increase
development of renewable energy production such as photovoltaic technology.

Nonlinear mechanical behaviour of cemented soils. This paper investigates the
nonlinear mechanical behaviour of cemented soils and cement-based grouted soils
viewed as multiphase materials. A secant linearization procedure has been
coupled to the Homogenization of Periodic Media in order to determine the
macroscopic behaviour of such structured soils from the knowledge of the
individual constituents behaviour and a detailed description of the
microstructure. The proposed approach allows to overcome mesh-dependency and
divergence problems encountered by direct methods in presence of softening laws.
Isotropic elastic damage behaviour is retained for the cement matrix, on the
basis of existing triaxial tests. The confrontation with experimental triaxial
tests on grouted soils has led us to introduce frictional aspects, which has
allowed to improve the model in terms of peak stress and dilation
characteristics.

Effect of weld metal toughness on fracture behavior under ultra-low cycle
fatigue loading earthquake. Results from 12 ultra-low cycle fatigue tests
performed on the weld metals of both toughness and non-toughness rated grades
are presented. Fracture resistance under these loadings seemed to be dependent
on materials' toughness, displacement amplitude, and stress state triaxiality,
while the toughness effect was more highlighted at high stress levels and
concentrations. To study the effect of microstructures on these failures,
supporting ancillary tests including all-weld tension coupons, Charpy V-notched
impact tests, and optical and scanning electron microscope analyses were
performed. The favored microstructures appeared to be those which absorbed
energy by plastic deformation and, hence, hindered void formation and/or could
avoid crack propagation by deflection. Considering the response of the tested
materials to cyclic loadings and the requirements of the materials specified in
AISC341 Provisions could question the adequacy of these requirements for weld
metals. However, the role of microstructural features like inclusions would be
the same in both the Charpy impact tests and ultra-low cycle loadings.

Effects of plasma shield plate design on epitaxial GaN films grown for large-
sized wafers in radical-enhanced metalorganic chemical vapor deposition.
Epitaxial growth of GaN films at a low temperature of was studied in radical-
enhanced metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, focusing on the discharge
region of the plasma of a mixture of N2 and H2 gases. The effect of plasma
confinement on the growth is crucial for realizing high crystal quality of grown
GaN films, owing to the suppression of plasma-induced damage and decomposition
of gallium precursors in the gaseous phase. By confined plasma in the discharge
region using the plasma shield plates made of metal with multiple small holes
effectively, GaN with a relatively flat surface was grown under conditions of
higher V/III ratios. Epitaxial growth of GaN films was achieved by modifying the
plate design and controlling the high V/III ratio using both the plasma-
excitation power and the Ga precursor flow rate.

Thermoelectric properties of SiC thick films deposited by thermal plasma
physical vapor deposition. SiC thick films of about 300 m could be prepared with
a deposition rate above 300 nm/s by thermal plasma physical vapor deposition
TPPVD using ultrafine SiC powder as a starting material. The thermoelectric
properties were investigated as a function of composition and doping content.
The nondoped films showed n-type conduction. Although the Seebeck coefficient
reached as high as 480 V/K, the power factor was only around 1.6104 W m1 K2 at
due to the relatively high electrical resistivity. In order to reduce the
electrical resistivity and to deposit layers with n-type and p-type conduction,
N2, B and B4C were selected as the dopants. Nitrogen-doped samples exhibit
n-type characterization, B and B4C-doped samples exhibit p-type
characterization, and the electrical resistivity decreased from 102103 to 104105

Effect of grain size on fatigue cracking at twin boundaries in a CoCrFeMnNi
high-entropy alloy. The fatigue cracking behavior at twin boundariesin a
CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy with three different grain sizes was
systematically investigated under low-cycle fatigue. Irrespective of grain size,
the change from slip band cracking to TB cracking occurred with increasing the
difference in the Schmid factors DSF between matrix and twin. However, the
required critical DSF for the transition of the dominant cracking mode decreases
with decreasing grain size due to the reduced slip band spacing that increases
the impingement sites on theand facilitates the coalescence of defects and voids
to initiate TB cracks.

Lapping flat surfaces with forced dosing of abrasive suspension. The issues
concerning the finishing of flat ceramic seals are presented in the paper. The
treatment requirements demanded from the elements of that type cause, that
necessary is application of grinding-in in the technological process. Such a
precise abrasive treatment of flat surfaces of that type, requires the use of an
appropriate suspended matter or abrasive paste. Many factors connected with
metal grinding-in shield, components of abrasive suspended matter and the
treatments technological conditions, have an impact on the treatments result.
The manner and intensity of the suspended matters proportioning in the grinding-
in are, are also of decisive nature. A standard, free manner of proportioning,
in a continuous manner most often dipping or dropping, results in big losses of
abrasive material. A part of abrasive micro-grains is quickly removed from the
operating grinding-in shield by the rotating rings leading separators with
treated elements and does not take part at all in machine cutting. It
considerably increases the tool costs and has an unfavourable impact on the
natural environment. Implementation of the forced abrasive suspended matters
proportioning at the time of the machine grinding-in, considerably reduces these
losses.

Microstructure and properties of extruded Al6Mg3Cr alloy prepared from rapidly

relationship between processing, microstructure, and mechanical properties of an
Al6Mg3Cr powder alloy consolidated by extrusion. Attention is focused on the
microstructure of the powder and the subsequent changes that occurred during
thermomechanical consolidation to a fully dense product. The powder
microstructure was composed of aggregates of three equilibrium phases
Al18Mg3Cr2, Al3Mg2, and Al13Cr2 which were uniformly distributed within an Al
matrix. Preheating to the extrusion temperature by induction had very little
effect on the microstructure. However, consolidation of the powder accompanied
by significant structural changes occurred during passage through the extrusion

Electrochemical characterization of a responsive macromolecular interface on
gold. This study reports on the investigation of a thermoresponsive polymer as a
thin film on electrodes and the influence of coupling a peptide and an antibody
to the film. The utilized polymer from the class of polyoligoethylene glycol-
methacrylate polymers polyOEGMA with carboxy functions containing side chains
was synthesized and properly characterized in aqueous solutions. The dependence
of the cloud point on the pH of the surrounding media is discussed. The
responsive polymer was immobilized on gold electrodes as shown by
electrochemical, quartz crystal microbalance QCM, and atomic force microscopy
AFM techniques. The temperature dependent behavior of the polymer covalently
grafted to gold substrates is investigated using cyclic voltammetry CV in
ferro-/ferricyanide solution. Significant changes in the slope of the
temperature-dependence of the voltammetric peak current and the peak separation
values clearly indicate the thermally induced conformational change on the
surface. Finally, a biorecognition reaction between a short FLAG peptide NAsp-
Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-C covalently immobilized on the polymer interface
and the corresponding IgG antibody was performed. The study shows that the
responsiveness of the electrode is retained after peptide coupling and antibody
binding, although the response is diminished.

The effect of in-plane strain on the electronic properties of LaAlO3/SrTiO3
interface. The effect of in-plane strain on the LaAlO3 /SrTiO3 interface is
investigated. The roughness of the interface becomes larger with decreasing
lattice constant. The interfacial Ti3 d xy electrons is the origin of the 2DEG
formed at the interface. In-plane strain can tailor the 2DEG and induce a metal-
insulator transition. The density functional theory DFT calculations are
employed to investigate the effect of in-plane strain on the lattice relaxation
and electronic properties of LaAlO3 /SrTiO3 interface. It is obtained that the
in-plane strain influences the lattice relaxation obviously. The distortion of
interfacial TiO octahedron is enhanced with the increasing of the in-plane
compressive strain. The Ti3 d xy orbital at the interface is partly filled and
it is the origin of the interfacial two-dimensional electron gas 2DEG. The in-
plane strain can effectively modulate the carrier concentration and consequently
the conductivity of the 2DEG formed at the interface. In-plane strain may reduce
the carrier concentration significantly and induce a metal-insulator transition
when the in-plane compressive tensile strain is added up to 4.98% 5.29%.

On Structural Stability of Nanostructured Aluminium. Nano- and submicron-
structured aluminium was produced by equal channel angular extrusion with a
total strain of ~17. Large residual stress and strain energy were built up in
the extruded metal and subsequent heat treatments were applied to investigate
the stability of the nanostructures. X-ray diffractometry and transmission
electron microscopy were performed to evaluate the microstructural changes in
the nanograin metal. It was found that the nanostructures remained stable at
temperatures up to. Above, changes in the major x-ray peak reflections became
evident, suggesting substantial grain growth had occurred. Electron microscopy
confirmed that at low annealing temperatures, the fine grain structures were
stable and indeed became more equiaxed and well defined.

Effect of TiN coating on corrosion fatigue strength of carbon steel.. In order
to investigate the effect of titanium nitride TiN coating on corrosion fatigue
behavior of metal, cantilever-type rotating bending corrosion fatigue tests were
carried out in 3.0% saline solution by using the round bar specimens of 0.37%C
carbon steel, JIS S35C, coated with TiN by the physical vapour deposition PVD
method or the chemical vapour deposition CVD method. From the experimental
results, obvious improvement of corrosion fatigue strength was observed in TiN
coated specimens, as compared with those without coating. The corrosion fatigue
crack propagation rate observed on the surface of coated specimens was
equivalent to that without coating. Fracture surface observations with a
scanning-electron microscope revealed that the corrosion fatigue crack
propagated from small corrosion pits formed at the base metal under the coating
layer due to aqueous solution transmitted throughout the small pinhole or flaw
of the coating. The causes of the improvement in the corrosion fatigue
resistance of TiN coated material were elucidated that the TiN layer does not
peel off from the substrate surface owing to its enough adhesion and corrosion
resistance of the layer itself is more excellent than that of the substrate
metal.

Modeling Solid-State Phase Transformations ofr-4NiSteels in Welding Heat-
Affected Zone. Fatigue damage is commonly encountered by operators of Francis
type hydraulic turbine runners made ofr-4Ni soft martensitic stainless steel.
These large and complex welded casting assemblies are subjected to fatigue crack
initiation and growth in the vicinity of their welded regions. It is well known
that fatigue behavior is influenced by residual stresses and the microstructure.
By including solid-state phase transformation models in welding simulations,
phase distribution can be evaluated along with their respective volumetric
change and their effect on residual stresses. Thus, it enables the assessment of
welding process on fatigue crack behavior by numerical methods. This paper
focuses on modeling solid-state phase transformations ofr-4Ni soft martensitic
stainless steel, used for manufacturing hydraulic turbine runners, occurring
upon welding. It proposes to determine the material parameters of the models for
both the austenitic and the martensitic transformation by nonisothermal
dilatometry tests. The experiments are conducted in a quenching dilatometer with
applied thermal conditions as experienced in the heat-affected zone of
homogeneous welds. The activation energy and the kinetic parameters of the
austenitic transformation from fully martensitic state are measured from the
experimental results. The martensitic transformation modeling from a fully
austenitic domain is also presented.

The superiority of superalloys. The structure and properties of superalloys and
the phase that forms their principal component are described. The properties of
each phase and the relation between the properties of the two phases combine to
produce the superior performance of superalloys. Nickel-based superalloys seem
to have reached the stage at which only modest incremental improvements in
performance seem likely. Major advances will be based on other alloy systems.
Will their performance be based on a different set of principles, or will it
depend on considerations very similar to those that account for the success of
the current superalloys? One of the strongest candidates for the next generation
of high-temperature creep-resistant alloys, the system TiAlTi3Al, is shown to
have many features in common with those of superalloys.

Pushing the frontiers of modeling excited electronic states and dynamics to
accelerate materials engineering and design. Electronic excitations and their
dynamics are oftentimes at the foundation of how we use and probe materials.
While recent experimental advances allow us to do so with unprecedented accuracy
and time resolution, their interpretation relies on solid theoretical
understanding. This can be provided by cutting-edge, first-principles
theoretical-spectroscopy based on many-body perturbation theory MBPT and time-
dependent density functional theory TDDFT. In this work we review some of our
recent results as successful examples for how electronic-structure methods lead
to interesting insight into electronic excitations and deep understanding of
modern materials. In many cases these techniques are accurate and even
predictive, yet they rely on approximations to be computationally feasible. We
illustrate the need for further theoretical understanding, using dielectric
screening as an example in MBPT and faster, more accurate numerical integrators
as a challenge for real-time TDDFT. Finally, we describe how incorporating
online databases into computational materials research on excited electronic
states can side-step the problem of high computational cost to facilitate
materials design.

Ultrasonic measurements of Young's modulus of Al2O3-based refractories at high
temperatures. A magnetostrictive ultrasonic pulse echo method, involving a
correction of the measured transit time, for the absolute measurement of Young's
modulus E at a high temperature 1800C is described. This technique is used to
investigate the variations in E for four large-grained Al2O3-based refractories
which differ in their manufacturing processes: fused casting, sintering or resin
impregnation. The results show that the usual decrease in E with increasing
temperature is only observed in pure fine ceramics with stable microstructures.
In this study, large variations in Young's modulus can occur at high

microstructural changes microcracking, sintering and glassy phase effects grain

Molecular dynamics simulations of stress-induced phase transformations and grain

used to study a stress-induced new grain formation mechanism at the crack tip of
a nanocrystalline -iron sample at temperatures ranging from 100 to. The stress-
induced formation of new bcc grains, created inside existing grains, is found to
occur through a metastable bcc to fcc phase transformation at the crack tip of
the sample. A NishiyamaWassermann orientation relationship is found between the
original bcc grain and the fcc phase and a KurdjumovSachs orientation
relationship is found between the new bcc grain created and the fcc transition

Fission gas swelling of refractory nuclear fuels. The external diametral

rates to temperature is consistent with a diffusional creep model of swelling of
fuels by fission gas pressures at these temperatures. Arguments are presented
which show that diffusional creep processes are required in the formation of
even the smallest of gas bubbles. Mechanisms are suggested by which gas bubble
growth by diffusional creep can continue to form bubbles of larger sizes without
invoking difficult bubble migration processes. The kinetic nature of high-
temperature fission gas swelling requires the existence of a rate process
dependent upon fuel properties. It is apparent that the most probable rate-
controlling processes are the coupled processes of diffusion of gas atoms to
clusters and of diffusion of vacancies, primarily Schottky vacancies, to both
atoms and clusters. The driving force for vacancy flow to the sites of gas atoms
is initially the lattice strain energy of the individual gas atoms and
subsequently the pressure of gas atoms in clusters or bubbles. This dynamic
driving force is reduced by the passive, temperature-independent force called
surface tension, but the former is always in excess to provide kinetic action
toward the equilibrium described by surface tension.

Investigating the Potential Use of Papaya Leaf Extract as Natural Dyes in the
Textile Industry. Synthetic dyes are widely used in the majority of the large
textile industry. The use of synthetic dyes can cause water pollution from
sewage disposal of the textile industry. Some types of synthetic dyes contain
heavy metals that are harmful to human health and can damage the environment.
With increasing awareness of the current environmental problems, people begin to
focus on returning back to natural dyes. These natural dyes can be extracted
from various parts of plants, such as leaves, flowers, fruit, wood or stems, and
roots. Papaya leaves have the potential to be used as a basic ingredient to make
natural dyes due to fairly high chlorophyll content. Therefore, we took the
initiative to conduct research on the production of natural dyes from papaya
leaf extract. Papaya leaf extract was produced by using a solid-liquid
extraction process using two different solvents, ethanol 96% and n-hexane. From
the results of the study, it was found that the most optimum extract results in
the extraction process was about 2.20% of the raw material of dried papaya
leaves by using ethanol solvent. The prepared cotton cloth was then colored with
papaya leaf extract through three simple steps, namely: mordanting, dyeing, and
fixation. Fabric staining results then tested its fastness by two methods,
namely the rub method and the washing method with soap. From the test results it
was found that the fabric which was dyed with papaya leaf extract was not too
resistant to fade from rubbing and soap washing. Therefore, further research is
needed, such as using other agents during the mordanting and fixation processes.

Metal-insulator-silicon semiconductor photodetectors using ZnO nanocones as an
efficient anti-reflective coating. Novel ZnO nanocone anti-reflective coating
ARC was realized on ITO-Si metalinsulatorsemiconductor MIS photodetector. The
ZnO nanocone-coated device demonstrated significant suppression of reflectance
compared with that of a conventional planar device. The ZnO nanocone MIS
photodetector showed a 15% enhanced external quantum efficiency EQE compared to
a planar MIS photodetector, and indicated a flat response over a broad range of
wavelength from the visible to IR spectra. In addition, the EQE of the nanocone
device exhibited a stable response with respect to the angle of incidence, which
indicates improved device characteristics of the ZnO nanocone ARC.

Creep characteristics of wire-drawn Cu-20%Nb. In this study the creep
deformation and rupture characteristics of a wire-drawn Cu-20%Nb composite are
investigated at and compared with the results obtained from pure copper. The
results show that the creep rupture strength of Cu-20%Nb is considerably higher
than that for pure copper. The rupture strength of Cu-20%Nb increases up to a
certain draw ratio, in contrast to the room temperature strengthening. The
stress exponents n are in the range 6.68.1 for Cu-20%Nb, in comparison with 2.75
in pure copper. The increase in the creep strength and the higher stress
exponent values in the Cu-20%Nb are associated with the reduction in the power
law creep damage mechanism. This is due to the constraint introduced on the
matrix creep flow by the niobium phase rather than the development of high
threshold stress values. While the increase in the length of niobium filaments
and reduction in interfilament spacing with increasing draw ratio increase the
constraint on the creep flow of the matrix, they also enhance the creep damage
caused by the diffusion mechanisms because of the easy diffusion paths along the
niobium filaments and the reduction in the matrix gain size.

Effect of Rare-Earth Element Y on the Microstructure and Mechanical Properties
of the Mg-6.0wt.%Zn-0.5wt.%Zr Alloy. The extruded Mg-6.0wt.%Zn-0.5wt.%Zr ZK60
alloys with 0.5wt.% and 1.0wt.% Y additions were prepared. The microstructures
and tensile properties of the alloys aged in different conditions were
investigated. The results show that the specimen with 1.0wt.% Y additions and
aged at for 15 h had the best tensile strength. The ultimate tensile strength
and yield strength reached 365MPa and 352MPa, respectively. The grain
refinement, the formation of the fine dispersed MgZn particles and the WMg3Zn3Y2
ternary phase may be the main reasons for the improvement. The average grain
size reached to ~ 3m. The size of the fine and dispersed particles was only
several nanometers and the particle number density N was very high. The
crystallographic characteristics of the ternary WMg3Zn3Y2 phase were studied by
the transmission electron microscope and selected area electron diffraction
techniques. The crystallographic orientation relationship between the W phase
and the -Mg matrix is identified as: 2 0 // w , 0002 plane near parallel to the
220 w plane with a 3.5 degree angle difference. This orientation relationship
has rarely been studied and reported.

Investigation and Analysis on Crystallization of Tunnel Drainage Pipes in
Chongqing. A lot of crystallizations exist on the inner wall of tunnel drainage
pipes in Chongqing. Tunnel support structure often bears larger load than usual
because the tunnel drainage pipes are blocked easily by the crystals and the
groundwater level would rise. In order to investigate what the crystals are,
site investigations and laboratory tests of crystals and groundwater were
completed. Some valuable results have been obtained. Firstly, the
crystallizations are usually discovered in drainage pipe exits of tunnels which
are under construction in Chongqing. Furthermore, the results of XRD have
confirmed that the crystals are calcite. And calcite morphology could be found
in most SEM images. But there are other morphologies in these images other than
calcite because calcite is often influenced by some factors, such as important
ions in groundwater, pH of groundwater, kinetics effect, and so on. Finally,
some steps and solutions to solve blocking of tunnel drainage pipes caused by
crystallization are suggested. One of the best solutions is that some special
materials which could prevent crystals from being attached to pipes are coated
on the inner surface of drainage pipes. The results could contribute to
understand the crystallization phenomenon profoundly and help solve the similar
situations of tunnel drainage pipe blocking.

Effects of the 1 precipitates on mechanical and damping properties of ZK60
magnesium alloy. A new approach to improve the damping capacity and mechanical
properties of ZK60 magnesium alloy at the same time is discovered by introducing
the 1 MgZn2 precipitates. The 1 precipitates are formed in the alloy experienced
solution treatment and subsequent aging at for 18 h in this study. The
synchronous improvement in mechanical and damping properties of the alloy is
mainly due to the coherent orientation relationships between the 1 phase and the
-Mg matrix, and the shearing or bypassing of dislocations on the 1 precipitates
depending on their sizes and spacing. The modified Granato-Lcke G-L model is
presented in this work to analyze the favorable damping capacity of the as-aged
ZK60 alloy and the interaction between the 1 precipitates and the mobile
dislocations is a new source of energy-dissipation.

Kinetics of oxide crystal growth in the transition regime between Cabrera-Mott
and Wagner thickness regions. We present a computational model for laser-induced
Wagner oxidation in air of metals. We assume that oxidation is diffusion
limited, but that the diffusion constant is a function of temperature. We
suppose that there are not temperature gradients in the metal, and that the
ambient temperature remains constant. Losses include convection and Stefan-
Boltzmann terms; from the oxide-air surface at the focal spot these are modelled
explicitly, and from the metal-oxide surfaces away from the focal spot they are
approximated. We plot the rate of oxide layer growth as a function of laser
power and time. The parabolic rate law in the case of a laser-induced oxidation
process seems to be valid from the thickness of the oxide layer of about 0.5 m
at long times and high powers, but it is not true for the very beginning of the
process for the metals without native oxide layers. At lower powers the validity
of the Wagner parabolic law takes place at later times of irradiation and the
mechanism of oxidation is governed by the temperature gradient in the oxide film
arising during scale growth. Comparison with experiment is made for the case of
vanadium/vanadium oxide systems.

annealed samples have been measured in the temperature range 25 to. On heat
treatment the sharp fall of resistance of the annealed films is attributed to
radical structural transformation from amorphous to crystalline. Electrical

Surface electronic properties of H-terminated diamond in contact with adsorbates
and electrolytes. A comprehensive summary of surface electronic properties of
undoped hydrogen terminated diamond covered with adsorbates or in electrolyte
solutions is given. The formation of a conductive layer at the surface is
characterized using Hall effect, conductivity, contact potential difference CPM,
scanning electron microscopy SEM, and cyclic voltammetry experiments. Data are
from measurements on homoepitaxially grown CVD diamond films with atomically
smooth hydrogen terminated surfaces. The data show that due to electron transfer
from the valence band into empty states in of the electrolyte, a highly
conductive surface layer is generated. Holes propagate in the layer with
mobilities up to 350 cm2/Vs. The sheet hole density in this layer is in the
range 1011 to 5 1012 cm2, and dependents on pH of the electrolyte or adsorbate.
This has been utilized to manufacture ion sensitive field effect transistors
ISFET from diamond. The drain source conductivity of single crystalline CVD
diamond is pH dependent, with about 66 mV/pH, which is in reasonable agreement
with the Nernst law. Due to strong coulomb repulsion between positive ions in
the electrolyte and the H+-surface termination of diamond, an enlarged tunneling
gap is established which prevents electronic interactions between the
electrolyte and diamond. This is a virtual gate insulator of diamond Application
of potentials larger than the oxidation threshold of +0.7 V pH 13 to +1.6 V pH 1
gives rise to strong leakage currents and to partial surface oxidation. In
addition, the electronic interaction of diamond with redox couples is
characterized using cyclic voltammetry experiments. The results are well
described by the transfer doping model which accounts for the specific
properties of undoped diamond immersed in electrolyte solutions are covered
simply by adsorbates. In addition, numerical solutions of the Schrodinger and
Poisson equations are used to show that the density of state distribution of
unoccupied valence band states in case of a perfect interface would be governed
by two-dimensional properties 2D. 2006 WILEY-VCHVerlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

The Effect of Mould Constraints on the 0.2% Proof Stress of AsCast MgAlAlloys.
When a casting solidifies and cools down in a metallic mould, stresses and
strains develop as a result of uneven temperature distributions, metal shrinkage
and mould constraints. At ejection from the mould, the casting usually springs
back slightly when the elastic part of the strain is released. However, due to
the low flow stress at high temperatures it is likely that the casting also has
experienced some plastic deformations, meaning that the dislocation density has
increased. This paper discusses how the existence of remaining plastic
deformations affects the initial flow behavior and the yield strength during
tensile testing of as cast MgAl alloys with different degrees of mould
constraints.

Device structures of Perovskite solar cells: A critical review. In recent years,

production, low cost, flexibility, long diffusion length, lightweight, and
higher performance compared to their counterparts. Thehave demonstrated
remarkable progress with PCE up to 25.7% using FAPbI3 as an active layer
component. However, the commercial viability of perovskite solar cells has been
restricted by a wide range of factors, such as lower PCE and device stability.
Further, the photocurrents inare close to the maximum Shockley- Queisser SQ
limit. The focus now is on enhancing the open-circuit voltage and fill factor
through modifying charge-selective contacts, the morphology of perovskite
material, and interface modification. The large grain size, uniformity, and
coverage area distinguish the crucial factors affecting the PCE of Long-term
device stability and degradation mechanisms have also shown significant
dependence on the device structure. Therefore, the tailoring of the device
structure continues to play a crucial role in the devices performance and
stability. In this review, the illustration of the structural development of
perovskite solar cells, including advanced interfacial layers and their
associated parameters, has been discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges

Cellular Functionality on Nanotubes of Ti-30TaAlloy. Recent studies have
identified strong correlations between anodized metals and the production of
highly biomimetic nanoscale topographies. These surfaces provide an interface of

anodization process was performed in an electrolyte solution containing HF48 %

sulfoxide DMSO at 35V for 40 min. Cellular analysis identified improved
fibroblast functionality on the nanotube surface, showing increased elongation,

with an ordering tendency case study on NiAl and NiZr melts and ii with a

and statistical mechanical analysis based on fundamental concepts of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem, generalized Langevin equation and Mori-Zwanzig
formalism. We also applied the developed theory to interpret recent available

In vitro evaluation of electrochemically bioactivated Ti6Al4V3 D porous
scaffolds. Triply periodic minimal surfaces TPMS are known for their advanced
mechanical properties and are wrinkle-free with a smooth local topology. These
surfaces provide suitable conditions for cell attachment and proliferation. In
this study, the in vitro osteoinductive and antibacterial properties of
scaffolds with different minimal pore diameters and architectures were
investigated. For the first time, scaffolds with TPMS architecture were treated
electrochemically by plasma electrolytic oxidation PEO with and without silver
nanoparticles AgNPs to enhance the surface bioactivity. It was found that the
scaffold architecture had a greater impact on the osteoblast cell activity than
the pore size. Through control of the architecture type, the collagen production
by osteoblast cells increased by 18.9% and by 43.0% in the case of additional
surface PEO bioactivation. The manufactured scaffolds demonstrated an extremely
low quasi-elastic modulus comparable with trabecular and cortical bone, which
was 510 times lower than that of bulk titanium 6.411.4 GPa vs 100105 GPa. The
AgNPs provided antibacterial properties against both gram-positive and gram-
negative bacteria and had no significant impact on the osteoblast cell growth.
Complex experimental results show the in vitro effectiveness of the PEO-modified

Preliminary Experimental Investigation on the Strength and Air Permeability of
Reactive Powder Concrete. A new reinforced concrete foundation system is being
proposed to store renewable energy through the compressed air energy storage
technology. For this application, the concrete is required to resist
considerable tensile strength and to have low air permeability, which is not
observed in normal concrete. Therefore, this paper is proposing to use reactive
powder concrete for the suggested foundation system. Reactive powder concrete
RPC is obtained by introducing either micro-cementitious materials like silica
fume or fine powders like crushed quartz into the concrete mixture from where
coarse aggregates had been removed. RPC has low water content and dense particle
packing which lead to high strength and low air permeability characteristics.
This paper conducts preliminary experimental investigations on the strength and
air permeability of the RPC. Two important mix design parameters are studied
including water-to-binder ratio ad silica fume content. Preliminary correlations
between mix design parameters and strength/air permeability are developed. From
the preliminary test results, it is concluded that the reactive powder concrete
has potential to meet the high strength and low air permeability requirements,
and is suitable for the proposed energy storage foundation system.

Influence of High-Energy Milling and Sintering Cycle on Obtaining TiAl from
Elemental Ti and AlPowders. The present work studies the influence of high-
energy milling HEM and sintering cycle of Ti and Al powders on the obtainment of
TiAl. This study shows that HEM modifies the diffusion processes during the
sintering stage. The ignition temperature of the exothermic reaction SHS that
occurs between Ti and Al, was considered as the key parameter of the sintering
process, leading to the study of sintering cycles that avoid uncontrolled
processes caused by the SHS reaction. The samples were obtained by cold uniaxial
and isostatic pressing, pre-sintered at different temperatures, and then heated
up to the sintering temperature. This study also shows the effect of powder
additions processed by HEM on the sintering behavior of blended elemental Ti and

Mesoscale Simulation of Grain Growth. Simulation is becoming an increasingly
important tool, not only in materials science in a general way, but in the study
of grain growth in particular. Here we exhibit a consistent variational approach
to the mesoscale simulation of large systems of grain boundaries subject to
Mullins Equation of curvature driven growth. Simulations must be accurate and at
a scale large enough to have statistical significance. Moreover, they must be
sufficiently flexible to use very general energies and mobilities. We introduce
this theory and its discretization as a dissipative system in two and three
dimensions. The approach has several interesting features. It consists in
solving very large systems of nonlinear evolution equations with nonlinear
boundary conditions at triple points or on triple lines. Critical events, the
disappearance of grains and and the disappearance or exhange of edges, must be
accomodated. The data structure is curves in two dimensions and surfaces in
three dimensions. We discuss some consequences and challenges, including some
ideas about coarse graining the simulation.

Local stress modification during in situ transmission electron microscopy
straining experiments. The stress distribution in a foil strained in situ in a
transmission electron microscope is strongly affected by the polished depression
and the hole. In the present study, this effect has been investigated in detail
on a FeSi foil plastically deformed under uniaxial straining in transmission
electron microscopy. The slip-trace direction varied considerably around the
hole, indicating local changes of the macroscopic slip plane. Since non-
crystallographic slip occurs in FeSi under conditions used in the experiment and
the crystallographic relation between the macroscopic slip plane and the tensile
stress direction is known, the local tensile axes could be established. It was
found that the deviations of the local tensile stress axis from the external
stress axis may be as large as 60. The stress distribution determined
experimentally is compared with an analytical solution as well as a finite
element analysis of the problem.

On the Stability of-SiCSingle Crystals at High Temperatures. The-6H polytypic
transition in-SiC single crystals is studied by means of diffuse X-ray
scattering DXS coupled with transmission electron microscopy TEM. TEM reveals
that the partially transformed SiC crystals contain regions of significantly
transformed SiC characterized by a high density of stacking faults co-existing
with regions of pure-SiC. The simulation of the diffuse intensity allows to
determine both the volume fraction of transformed material and the
transformation level within these regions. It is further shown that the
evolution with time and temperature of the transition implies the multiplication
and glide of partial dislocations, the kinetics of which are quantified by means
of DXS.

molecular dynamics MD framework employing an angular-dependent interatomic
potential ADP. The incipient crack tip event was analyzed using a mixed-mode
displacement solution for mode-I and mode-II crack tip fields. The critical
stress intensity factor for the onset of the crack tip deformation event was
evaluated. A detailed description based on a von Mises atomic shear strain
analysis revealed that the presence of hydrogen near a crack tip significantly
inhibited the activities of emitted partial dislocations. The hydrogen locking
of dislocations near a crack tip was found to facilitate the local amorphization
of the crack tip, which considerably reduced the critical stress intensity
factor for the onset of crack growth. The effect of the loading mode on the
atomic-scale mechanism of the hydrogen embrittlement HE was further analyzed,
and the explicit dependence of in-plane shear loading was observed.

Effect of the Reinforcement Volume Fraction on Mechanical Alloying of AA2124
SiCComposite. Mixtures of AA2124 aluminum alloy powder and SiC particles at
volume fractions of 10 vol.% and 20 vol.% were milled in a high energy planetary
ball mill under an argon atmosphere, for times of 2.5h to 60 h, aiming to
produce Al alloy-SiC nanocomposites. Optical microscopy MO and scanning electron
microscopy SEM were used to evaluate the morphological and microstructural
evolution of the powder composite, occurred during mechanical alloying. The
crystallite size was determined using the Williamson-Hall method to analyze the
X-ray peak broadening. It was observed that increasing the volume fraction of
SiC, the mechanical alloying stages were accelerated: a finer composite powder
was obtained at a shorter milling time as well as the morphology of the
particles became more equiaxed. The XRD analysis showed the reduction of
crystallite size of the aluminum alloy matrix with increasing milling time and
that this effect is more pronounced with high volume fraction of SiC. The
results show that the increase in the volume fraction of reinforcement particles
increases the work hardening and fracture occurrence in the aluminum alloy
powder during the milling, affecting the structural evolution of the composite.

Cell Immobilization Strategies for Tissue Engineering: Recent Trends and Future
Perspectives. Cell immobilization is the process of localizing intact cells onto
specific regions in a device or material without the loss of requisite
biological function. Immobilization of cells can generally be performed through
physical adsorption, encapsulation, entrapment and self-aggregation. Various
types of cells, including microbial, plant, mammalian and insect cells, have
been immobilized on materials for improving the bio-synthesis, bioanalytics, as
well as cell therapy applications. Recently, cell immobilization on
biomaterials-based 3-D scaffolds has gained attention in the area of
regenerative medicine and tissue engineering wherein the transplantation of
immobilized cells has been utilized in repair, restoration or improvement of
tissue function. This chapter will majorly focus on different mammalian cell
immobilization techniques, physio-chemical properties of matrix materials
employed for cell immobilization and their applications in tissue engineering.

Fire and Corrosion Resistances of Intumescent Nano-coating Containing Nano-SiO2
in Salt Spray Condition. The nano-concentrates and flame retardant nano-coating
were prepared in thhis study. The effect of nano-SiO2 on the corrosion
resistance and fire resistance of ammonium polyphosphate-pentaerythritol-
melamine APP-PER-MEL coating was investigated by differential thermal analysis
DTA, scanning electron microscopy SEM, effective thermal conductivity lambda/d,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS and fire protection test. The chemical
action and endothermic effect of ammonium polyphosphate, pentaerythritol and
melamine in traditional flame retardant coating were damaged by salt spray
condition, whereas the flame-retardant additives in the nano-coating
demonstrated the good chemical interaction in salt spray condition. The
uniformly dispersed nano-SiO2 particles could improve corrosion resistance of
the coating, and hence nano-coating could remain the good fire-resistant
properties even after 500 h salt spray test.

Effect of cooling rate on the atomic and crystal structure of rapidly cooled
Fe75Si15B10. The alloy Fe75Si15B10 was formed as ribbon by melt spinning and as
powder by gas-water atomization and by spark erosion in dodecane and liquid
argon. The 27 m ribbon and 2030 m particles formed by spark erosion in dodecane
were completely amorphous while the gas-water-atomized 2030 m particles and the
particles spark eroded in liquid argon were about 50% and 80%90% crystalline
respectively. The cooling rate for the ribbon was 10 s 1 and that for the 2030 m
particles spark eroded in dodecane was in excess of 5 10 s 1 . The cooling rate
of the particles spark eroded in liquid argon was about 5 10 s 1 ; the cooling
rate for the gas-water-atomized particles was therefore between 5 10 5 and 10 s
1 . It appears that Fe75Si15B10 is not an easy alloy to obtain in the amorphous
form and that the difference between the cooling rate required to form
completely crystalline material and that to form completely amorphous material
is less than an order of magnitude.

Effect of Membrane Properties on Performance of Membrane Distillation for
Ammonia Removal. Membrane distillation MD has received much attention in recent
years as an alternative technology for the removal of volatile compounds from
industrial waters. The microporous hydrophobic membrane utilised in MD allows
only vapour passing through and the process selectivity is essentially
determined by the liquid-vapour equilibrium conditions existing at the liquid-
membrane interface. In this study, a series of asymmetrically structured
polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF hollow fibre membranes were fabricated and tested
for the removal of ammonia from simulated industrial wastewater. The asymmetric
membranes contain very thin skin layer with macrovoids supported underneath.
Hollow fibre MD modules with membrane area of 0.06 m2 have been assembled and
tested for dilute aqueous solutions containing ammonia at concentrations <1000
mg/L. The membranes were characterised in terms of porosity, thickness,
hydrophobicity, water permeability, surface roughness and zeta potential. Sweep
gas MD configuration was employed for all experiments and >90% ammonia removal
could be achieved. The results from the MD experiments were compared and the
effect of membranes characteristics was discussed.

Elastic, thermodynamic and electronic properties of LaF3 under pressure from
first principles. The elastic, thermodynamic and electronic properties of LaF3
in tysonite structure have been investigated by density functional theory method
within the frame of the local density approximation LDA. The calculated lattice
parameters of LaF3 under zero temperature and zero pressure are in good
agreement with the experimental data. The calculated elastic constants also
agree well with the available experimental data and other theoretical ones. The
results show that the c axis of LaF3 is slight more incompressible than the a
axis. It is mechanically stable up to 21GPa. The pressure dependences of the
elastic constants, Debye temperatures, Poissons ratio, sound velocity and
mechanical stability of LaF3 have also been systematically investigated. Based
on the quasi-harmonic approximation model, the thermodynamic properties of LaF3
have been studied. In the pressure range studied, the stability of the phonon is
confirmed and its change tendency is revealed. The electronic structure
calculations show that the tysonite phase of LaF3 is a direct band gap insulator

Fabrication and Evaluation of the Novel Elastomer Based Nanocomposite with
Pressure Sensing Function. A novel organic/inorganic composite material which
can work as a pressure sensor has been synthesized. This composite basically
contains nano-sized carbon particles as conductive filler into an elastomer
matrix to achieve pressure sensitive function. The superior pressure sensitive
effect was showed at 0.88vol% of carbon particles while in the previous study
the micro-sized carbon particle was required above 30vol%. In addition, nano-
sized silica particles were added to reinforce electrical insulation properties
and to improve the pressure sensing reliability of the composite. The addition
of the surface modified silica improved better both the sensing performance and
the mechanical strength than the composite containing non-modified silica
particles. These polymer-based sensors have economical advantage due to low cost
production regardless of the high performance.

Controlled bacteriostasis of tea polyphenol loaded ultrahigh molecular weight
polyethylene with high crosslink density and oxidation resistance for total
joint replacement. To avoid catastrophic bacterial infection in prosthesis
failure, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene UHMWPE, a common bearing
material of artificial joints, has been formulated with antibiotics to eliminate
bacteria locally at the implant site. However, the pressing issues regarding
cytotoxic effects and evolution of drug resistant bacteria necessitates the
development of bio-friendly bacteriostat with long bacteriostatic efficacy.
Herein, tea polyphenol extracted from nature source was introduced in UHMWPE as
a biogenic antimicrobial. Controlled antimicrobial activity was achieved by
chemical crosslinking to regulate the release of the tea polyphenol. In
addition, the crosslinking efficiency of UHMWPE blends with high loaded tea
polyphenol was significantly improved in comparison to radiation crosslinking.
The immobilized tea polyphenols also enhanced the oxidation stability of the
UHMWPE, which is essential to prolong the service life in vivo and the storage
time in vitro. The blends presented good biocompatibility, despite cell
repellent on the highly crosslinked surface. Chemically crosslinked tea
polyphenol/UHMWPE exhibited feasible properties for total joint implants, which
is promising for clinical application. Tea polyphenol/UHMWPE was fabricated to
treat periprosthetic joint infection. Controlled bacteriostasis was achieved by
regulating release of tea polyphenols. The tea polyphenols enhanced oxidation
stability and crosslink density of UHMWPE. The bacteriostatic mechanism was
revealed by the ROS and ATP leakage of bacteria.

The Effect of Strain Rate on the Tensile Deformation Behavior of Single Crystal,
NiBased Superalloys. Single crystal Nickel-based superalloys exhibit an
anomalous yield point, the yield stress increasing with temperature to a maximum
at around. Here, we demonstrate in the alloy CMSX-4 at that, although there is
virtually no effect of strain rate on the initial yield point, at slow strain
rates a second mechanism can initiate leading to a considerable softening
effect. By examining the microstructures of a series of interrupted tests, this
is attributed to the initiation of stacking fault shear after the operation of a
secondary slip system. Using high-resolution TEM, the dislocation structures are
shown to be identical in both structure and in the segregation of Co, Cr, and W,
to those observed during creep deformation of single crystal alloys, although
the conformation of the dislocations and faults differs from that observed
during creep. This drop in flow stress at low strain rates is not observed in
the alloys TMS138A and SRR99, in the former case, the improved creep resistance
of this fourth-generation alloy would require a much slower strain rate to match
the creep rate achievable at this temperature.

Tensile test of lead zirconate titanate PZT/Platinum Pt thin film. This paper
presents the results of tensile tests for lead zirconate titanate PZT/Platinum
Pt thin films of 2.15 m thickness in atmospheric air at room temperature. An
axial loading tester developed by the authors was used for the tests. The tester
was equipped with a load cell with a maximum capacity of 0.5 N and a non-contact
position measuring system based on the principle of capacitance micrometry.
Furthermore, the tester was equipped with a CCD charge-coupled device system for
measuring the displacement of the gage length. Specimens with three different
widths 50, 100 and 150 m were fabricated to study the size width of specimen
effects. The elastic moduli of the specimens with 50, 100 and 150 m width were
72.8 3.7, 75.0 1.3, 73.3 1.8 GPa, respectively. In addition, the ultimate
tensile strength of the specimens with 50, 100 and 150 m width were 263.4 21.1,
238.6 4.5, 221.1 13.9 MPa, respectively. It was observed that the width of
specimen has little effect on the elastic modulus of PZT/Pt thin films but has
an effect on the ultimate tensile strength of PZT/Pt thin films and the ultimate
tensile strength decreases as the width increases. It was assumed that the
scatter in the ultimate tensile strength of 50 m width was attributed to
delamination of PZT/Pt layers before the fracture in the tensile test. The 0.2%
offset yield strength could not be measured because the PZT/Pt thin film is very
brittle.

Super Low Loss Guided Wave Bands Using Split Ring Resonator-Rod Assemblies as
Left-Handed Materials. SRR metamaterial is used as a substrate material in a
microstrip guided wave structure to determine what the effect is of a material
with potentially excessive dispersion or loss or both. A Greens function method
readily incorporates the metamaterial permittivity and permeability tensor
characteristics. Ab initio calculations are performed to obtain the dispersion
diagrams of several complex propagation constant modes of the structure.
Analytical analysis is done for the design and interpretation of the results,
which demonstrate remarkable potential for realistic use in high frequency
electronics while using the LHM for possible field reconfigurations. Bands of
extremely low loss appear for several of the lowest order modes operating in the
millimeter wavelength regime.

A Fracture Mechanics Investigation on Crack Growth in Massive Forming. To
understand the crack growth in massive forming and to consequentially avoid
crack growth in workpieces, it is necessary to investigate its dependence on the
crack depth and thus on the state of hydrostatic stress. Prior work shows that
the crack opening displacement COD for shallow cracked tension specimens with
low stress triaxiality is twice as high as for deep cracked specimens with high
stress triaxiality. This work examines the crack growth in compression specimens
with pre-cracked cylindrical upsetting samples. The compression samples were cut
in the stress symmetry plane in order to observe crack initiation and crack
growth by a single specimen technique. In this way it is possible to observe
blunting, crack initiation and crack growth inside the upsetting specimens. The
resulting COD does not differ significantly from the values achieved in tension
samples with short surface cracks.

Rapid Dissolution of Secondary Phase in Cold-Rolling AlCuMgAlloy by
Electropulsing Treatment. The AlCuMg alloy is a precipitation-strengthening
alloy, which is traditionally dissolving lots of secondary phase and
precipitating in subsequent aging process, thus having been applied to aerospace
and automobile industry due to its low density and high strength. However, the
high temperature and long operating time needed for the dissolution of secondary
phase consume numerous energy. In this work, rapid dissolution of secondary
phase in cold-rolling AlCuMg alloy was achieved by coupling treatment of thermal
field and pulsed electric current. The energy consumption for dissolving
secondary phasewas reduced from operating 1h to operating several minutes.
Therefore, the coupling treatment of thermal field and pulsed electric current
significantly improves the dissolving rate and decreases the energy consumption.

First-Principles Calculations of Titanium Dopants in Alumina. First-principles
pseudopotential calculations were performed to investigate atomic and electronic
structures of titanium Ti dopants in alumina Al2O3. It was found that a
substitutional Ti3+ defect induced an extra level occupied by one electron
within the band gap of Al2O3. When two or more substitutional Ti3+ defects were
located closely to each other, the defect-induced levels exhibited strong
bonding interactions, and their formation energies decreased with increasing
numbers of Ti3+ defects. This indicates that association and clustering of
substitutional Ti3+ defects in Al2O3 can take place due to the interaction of
the defect-induced levels.

Photo-assisted green synthesis of silver doped silk fibroin/carboxymethyl
cellulose nanocomposite hydrogels for biomedical applications. Silver
nanoparticles AgNPs and regenerated silk fibroin RSF have recently attracted
significant interests for their potential applications in preventing wound-
related infections and in tissue engineering. Indeed, nano-silver has long been
recognized as one of the most effective antimicrobial agents, and silk fibroin
is well known for its capability of stimulating cell activities and facilitating
tissue regeneration. In this study, a green synthesis approach was used to
create a composite hydrogel CoHy of RSF stabilized with CarboxymethylCellulose-
NaCMC-Na and loaded with AgNPs. Their swelling ratios were up to 59 g/g when
tested in different physiologically relevant fluids. Material characterizations
by Scanning electron microscopy SEM with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy
EDS, and X-Ray Diffraction XRD confirmed the presence of AgNPs on the surface.
Antimicrobial properties of the CoHy samples were evaluated using agar diffusion
tests. The results showed distinct inhibition zones against major microorganisms
found in wound infections, including Escherichia coli E. coli, Staphylococcus
aureus S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis S. epidermidis, Methicillin
Resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa,
Candida albicans C. albicans and Fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans FRCA.
Cytocompatibility studies with rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cellsin
vitro showed that the adhesion density of BMScs on the CoHy loaded with 1 mg/mL
was similar to the cell-only control group for the first 24 h of culture;
moreover, higher cell proliferation was observed on the CoHy without AgNPs,
indicating the regenerative potentials of the RSF/CMC composite hydrogels.

A modified criterion for shear band formation in bulk metallic glass under
complex stress states. A new criterion for shear band formation in metallic
glasses is proposed based on the shear plane criterion proposed by Packard and
Schuh 1. This modified shear plane MSP criterion suggests that a shear band is
not initiated randomly throughout the entire material under stress but is
initiated at the physical boundaries or defects and at locations where the
highest normal stress modified maximum shear stress occurs. Moreover, the same
as in the shear plan criterion, the shear stress all over the shear band should
exceed the shear yield strength of the material. For a complete shear band to
form, both requirements need to be fulfilled. The shear yield strength of the
material is represented by the shear stress of the point at which the shear band
stops. The new criterion agrees very well with experimental results in both the
determination of the shear yield strength and the shear band path. C2010

Dose loss and segregation of boron and arsenic at the Si/SiO2 interface by
atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Continuum downscaling of MOSFET
devices requires of ultra-shallow junction formation. Performance of the source
and drain from B andlow energy implant and subsequent annealing is seriously
affected by the presence of the SiSiO2 interface. Dopant loss due to segregation
and dopant pileup at the interface during the transient enhanced diffusion TED
are crucial phenomena for current and future CMOS devices. In this work we have
implemented the Oh-Ward model Y.-S. Oh, D.E. Ward, Tech. Dig. Int. Electron
Devices Meet. 1998 1998 509 for the dopant behaviour at the interfaces
integrated in an atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulator. Dopant traps at the
interface can capture from or emit to either side of the interface. Furthermore,
segregation of dopants and saturation of the interface by the presence of other
species are also included.a test of the model, low energy implants through a
screen oxide have been simulated. When annealing these very shallow implants, a
pileup at the interface is observed. The mechanisms involved in this process, as
well as its dependence on the implant dose and energy are discussed.

test at 450, 500 and under the strain rates of 00001, 00005, 0001 and 001 s1.
The compression flow curves exhibited an initial sharp increase with strain
followed by a moderate work hardening behaviour. The maximum stress was
decreased as the strain rate reduced and the temperature increased. At the
lowest examined temperature 450C and the highest applied strain rate 001 s1, a
flow softening behaviour was observed. This was attributed to the morphological
changes of the present precipitates.

sizes, and sintering properties of TiO2 gels were investigated by using
thermogravimetry TG, differential thermal analysis DTA, X-ray diffractometer
XRD, dilatometer and scanning electron microscopy SEM. With increasing aging
time, the hydroxyl ions existing in the anatase lattice decreased, and so the
oxygen vacancy concentration produced after calcination decreased. Consequently,
increasing aging time during sintering lowered the crystallite growth rate of
anatase. The densification of the TiO2 powders was dependent upon the aging time
which shifted the anataserutile ar-TiO2 phase transformation to higher
temperature and lowered the crystallite growth rate during sintering.

Flexural Strengthening of Damaged T-Joists with Severe Corrosion Using CFRP
Sheets. This paper evaluates the residual safety of isolated T-joists with
severe corrosion for the two extreme cases of boundary conditions, simply
supported and fixed-ended, in order to help in making decisions about the
magnitude of the necessary intervention. When the T-joist is part of a complete
slab, the boundary conditions will be in an intermediate situation between these
two extreme cases, so that it is possible to assess the safety with respect to
its degree of embedding. The research is conducted for the cases of healthy
T-joist, T-joist with complete corrosion of the lower reinforcement, and
repaired T-joists with a variable number of CFRP sheets. This work is based on
the ACI 318 load test to maintain a structure in use and proposes a Load Factor
LF, which estimates the safety reserve. The simply supported T-joists specimens
with severe corrosion do not meet the Load Factor or ACI 318 criteria, even with
a large number of CFRP sheets. On the other hand, fixed-ended cases can be kept
in use despite corrosion by applying light CFRP strengthening, and with four
sheets the initial safety is restored.

A nanometer scale surface morphology study of W thin films. Microstructure of
tungsten thin films deposited by RF-sputtering is studied as a function of their
thicknesses. These films have been deposited on 100 oriented single crystal Si
substrate and Si substrate covered by a 100-nm-thick Ti layer. The crystalline
structure is studied by X-ray Diffraction XRD and Grazing Incidence XRD GIXRD.
The surface and the cross-section morphology are observed by high resolution
Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM and Atomic Force Microscopy AFM. XRD patterns
exhibit peaks corresponding to pure W phase. GIXRD analysis shows that the more
the thickness increases, the more the film is oriented along the 110 direction.
AFM observations show that films exhibit a particular morphology constituted of
piles of platelets oriented perpendicularly to the wafer surface. These piles of
platelets are in plane randomly oriented and are sometime observed upon all the
thicknesses of the layer. This particular morphology is observed whatever the
substrate is, and is explained by thin layer growth theories.

Applicability of sol-gel processing in production of silica based optical
fibres. The production of silica based optical fibres is a mature technology and
the chemical vapour deposition techniques used to obtain high quality glass are
now well established. Sol-gel technology is associated with glassmaking at
relatively low temperatures and since the early 1980s has been actively studied
in many leading laboratories all over the world; over the past decade the number
of scientific publications in the field has dramatically increased. At present
there are still only a few industrial applications using sol-gel processing, but
the potential is growing for high technology applications including optical

Effects of Variable La/CeRatio on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of
Mg-5Al-0.3Mn-1RE Alloys. Effects of variable La/Ce ratio on microstructure and
mechanical properties of Mg-5Al-0.3Mn-1RE alloys were investigated. The results
indicated that pure La or pure Ce can improve ultimate strength and yield
strength of AM50 effectively without obvious decrease of elongation, and the
effect of La is better than that of Ce. However, addition of La and Ce together
deteriorates the mechanical properties of AM50, and the valley of mechanical
properties mostly appears on La:Ce= 1:1. The existence of coarse skeleton-like
phase and less amount of Mg17Al12 phase is responsible for this.

Fatigue Crack Growth Behavior of High Manganese Austenitic TWIP Steels. Fatigue
crack growth FCG behavior of three high manganese austenitic twin-induced
plasticity TWIP steels with different stacking fault energy SFE was
investigated, aiming at studying the correlation between the FCG resistance and
the SFE of the steels. FCG tests were performed using three-point bending
specimens at room temperature at stress ratio of 0.1 under the control of stress
intensity factor range. Test results showed that the fatigue threshold values of
these steels decrease with increasing the SFE. However, in the Paris regime, the
crack growth rates of the steels do not appear to correlate directly with SFE.
These results are discussed according to the degree of fatigue crack closure and
the deformation mode of crack tip zone.

Effect of sputtering power on optical properties of prepared TiO2 thin films by
thermal oxidation of sputtered Ti layers. In this research, TiO2 thin films
prepared via thermal oxidation of Ti layers were deposited by RF-magnetron
sputtering method at three different sputtering powers. The effects of
sputtering power on structure, surface and optical properties of TiO2 thin films
grown on glass substrate were studied by X-ray diffraction XRD, atomic force
microscopic AFM and UVvisible spectrophotometer. The results reveal that, the
structure of layers is changed from amorphous to crystalline at anatase phase by
thermal oxidation of deposited Ti layers and rutile phase is formed when
sputtering power is increased. The optical parameters: absorption coefficient,
dielectric constants, extinction coefficient, refractive index, optical
conductivity and dissipation factor are decreased with increase in sputtering
power, but increase in optical band gap is observed. The roughness of thin films
surface is affected by changes in sputtering power which is obtained by AFM

Surface-gel-conversion synthesis of submicron-thick MFI zeolite membranes to
expedite shape-selective separation of hexane isomers. Ultrathin zeolite
membranes are of paramount importance in accelerating gas transport during
membrane separation, and lowering down their membrane thicknesses to submicron
scale is deemed to be very challenging. Herein, we develop an advanced approach
of surface gel conversion for synthesis of submicron-thick pure silica MFI
silicalite-1 zeolite membranes. Viscous gel is prepared by finely adjusting the
precursor composition, enabling its reduced wettability. The unfavorable wetting
of the support surface can effectively prevent gel penetration into alumina
support voids. Aided by the seeds, the surface gel is directly and fully
crystallized into an MFI zeolite membrane with minimal water steam. A membrane
with a thickness of 500 nm is successfully acquired and it is free of visible
cracks. Additionally, the as-synthesized membranes exhibit rapid and selective
separation of hexane isomers by virtue of unprecedentedly high n-hexane
permeance of 24.5107 mol m2 s1 Pa1 and impressive separation factors of
13.3-22.6 for n-hexane over its isomers. This developed approach is of practical
interest for sustainable synthesis of high-quality zeolite membranes.

Molecular dynamics simulation of Surface-Adsorbed-Hydrogen-Induced Dislocation
Motion in a thin film. Elucidating the effects of hydrogen on dislocation
activities is important for revealing hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms. In situ
transmission electron microscopy observations have shown that dislocation motion
is enhanced or activated when hydrogen gas is introduced into the sample
chamber, supporting the hydrogen-enhanced localized-plasticity mechanism.
However, adsorbed hydrogen atoms affect dislocation activities in thin films.
Here we analyzed the effects of hydrogen and sample thickness on the motion of
screw dislocations through molecular dynamics simulations. The surface effect
becomes significant with decreasing sample thickness, and the change in surface
energy upon hydrogen adsorption induces motion of screw dislocations in
ultrathin films.

A Technique of Elaboration of Functionally Graded Cermets. Out first results
concerning the elaboration of Functionally Graded Cermets FGC are presented. The
studied material is an alumina matrix with a SnPb alloy graded fraction. In a
first step, an unidirectional gradient of graphite volume fraction in alumina is
obtained by sedimentation of a mixing of the alumina and graphite powders. Then,
during the sintering stage, the graphite burns and acts as porosity inducing
element. Finally, the FGC is obtained by pressure infiltration of a molten SnPb
alloy into the graded porosity of the alumina preform. The distribution of the
SnPb alloy through the composite is characterised by SEM observations and
microhardness tests. From a qualitative point of view, the shape of the
gradients in the sample, deduced from the hardness measurements, agree with a
simple simulation of the graphite gradient in the alumina deposit, based on
Stockes law.

Atomic diffusion in laser surface modified AISI H13 steel. This paper presents a
laser surface modification process of AISI H13 steel using 0.09 and 0.4 mm of
laser spot sizes with an aim to increase surface hardness and investigate
elements diffusion in laser modified surface. A Rofin DC-015 diffusion-cooled
CO2 slab laser was used to process AISI H13 steel samples. Samples of 10 mm
diameter were sectioned to 100 mm length in order to process a predefined
circumferential area. The parameters selected for examination were laser peak
power, pulse repetition frequency PRF, and overlap percentage. The hardness
properties were tested at 981 mN force. Metallographic study and energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDXS were performed to observe presence of
elements and their distribution in the sample surface. Maximum hardness achieved
in the modified surface was 1017 HV0.1. Change of elements composition in the
modified layer region was detected in the laser modified samples. Diffusion
possibly occurred for C, Cr, Cu, Ni, and S elements. The potential found for
increase in surface hardness represents an important method to sustain tooling
life. The EDXS findings signify understanding of processing parameters effect on

Deformation induced martensitic transformation in stainless steels. Deformation
induced martensitic transformation was investigated in metastable austenitic
stainless steel. This steel can present a microstructure of austenite ,
martensite and non magnetic e martensite. Uni-axial tensile test was used for
loading at different temperatures below room temperature from 120 to. During the
deformation the transformation takes place at certain places in an anisotropic
way and texture also develops. Quantitative phase analysis was done by X-ray
diffraction XRD and magnetic methods while the texture was described by X-ray
diffraction using a special inverse pole figure. The quantitative phase analysis
has shown that the formation of and e martensite from austenite is the function
of deformation rate, and deformation temperature. The transformation of the
textured austenite takes place in an anisotropic way and a well defined
crystallographic relationship between the parent and martensite phase has been
measured.

Experimental study of vibroinsulating properties of modern structural
polyurethane. Modern mechanical engineering often uses polyurethane elastomers
as vibroinsulating material. It is difficult to choose the most perfect
structural polyurethane among a large number of proposed materials for
manufacturing shock absorbers. The article presents experimental research of
vibroinsulating properties using two parameters out of five. Based on
preliminary tests, an implicit preference is given to one of the three proposed
materials. The energy absorption coefficient and the creep of the elastomer are
chosen as criteria for evaluating the vibroinsulation properties of polyurethane
elastomers. Final choice of polyurethane elastomer for shock absorbers
manufacturing could be made if additional tests are carried out for studying
three criteria.

High Temperature Oxidation of TiAl-1.5wt.%Mn-0, 5, 10wt.%Y2O3Alloys.
TiAlMn-0,5,10 wt.%Y2O3 alloys were prepared by the MA-SPS process, and their
oxidation behavior was studied between 800 and in 1 atm of air. The added Y2O3
particles were segregated along the matrix grain boundaries. The addition of
5~10 wt.%Y2O3, viz. 0.9~1.8 mol%Y2O3 increased the tendency to form the rutile
phase along the grain boundaries, resulting in the increment of the oxidation
rate and decrement of scale adherence. Mn was oxidized to Mn2O3. The primary
mode of scale growth was the outward diffusion of Ti and Mn cations for the
outer TiO2 scale, and the inward transport of oxygen anions for the inner

The optimum condition for the vibration was examined to yield the most

Effects of Zn on microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion behavior of

MgZn alloys typically consists of primary -Mg matrix and MgZn intermetallic

performances for MgZn alloys with Zn content until 5% of weight is corresponding
to fine grain strengthening, solid solution strengthening and second phase
strengthening. Polarization test has shown the beneficial effect of Zn element
on the formation of a protective film on the surface of alloys. Mg5Zn alloy
exhibits the best anti-corrosion property. However, further increase of Zn
content until 7% of weight deteriorates the corrosion rate which is driven by

Dislocation structures introduced by high-speed deformation in bcc metals.
Systematic experiments were carried out over a wide range of strain rate, 10 0
-10 6 s -1 , so as to reveal the deformation mode in bcc crystals, especially at
high strain rate. Dislocation structure showed heterogeneous distribution at low
strain rates in all three bcc metals examined. At higher strain rates exceeding
10 3 s -1 , distribution of dislocations was random, and the formation of small
dislocation loops was observed in V and Nb. InMo, small dislocation loops were
not formed by deformation, even at high strain rates. However, post-deformation
annealing of an Mo specimen that had been deformed by 20% at 5 x 10 5 s -1
produced dislocation loops. The inside-outside contrast method identified these
loops to be of vacancy type. These results reveal that in Mo vacancy clusters
are not formed directly from the interaction of dislocations, but by the
aggregation of vacancies. InV and Nb, the same formation process is believed to
occur at high strain rates. These results suggest that the different mode of
plastic deformation at high strain rates accompanied by production of vacancies
also occurred in bcc metals.

Ordering-induced Elinvar effect over a wide temperature range in a spinodal
decomposition titanium alloy. Temperature-independent elastic modulus is termed
as Elinvar effect, which is available by tuning the continuous spin transition
of ferromagnetic alloys via composition optimization and the first-order
martensitic transformation of shape memory alloys via plastic deformation.
However, these reversible mechanisms are restricted generally in a narrow
temperature range of less than. Here reports, by tuning a spinodal decomposition
in a TiNb-based titanium alloy via aging treatment, both the Elinvar effect in a
wide temperature range of about and a high strength-to-modulus ratio of about
1.5% can be obtained by a continuous and reversible crystal ordering mechanism.
The results demonstrate that the alloy aged at for 4 h has a nanoscale plate-
like modulated +" two-phase microstructure and its elastic modulus keeps almost
constant from 100 to. Synchrotron and in-situ X-ray diffraction measurements
reveal that the crystal ordering parameter of the " phase increases linearly
with temperature from 0.88 at to 0.97 at but its volume fraction keeps a
constant of about 33.8%. This suggests that the continuous ordering of the "
phase toward the high modulus phase induces a positive modulus-temperature
relation to balance the negative relation of the elastically stable phase. The
aged alloy exhibits a high yield strength of 1200 MPa, good ductility of 16% and
a high elastic admissible strain of 1.5%. Our results provide a novel strategy
to extend the Elinvar temperature range and enhance the strength by tuning the
crystal ordering of decomposition alloys.

Size controlled, antimicrobial ZnO nanostructures produced by the microwave
assisted route. Zinc oxide nanostructures ZnONS have shown to be of great value
for several biological and biomedical applications. In particular, they have
been used in bioimaging and delivery applications as well as inhibitors of
microbial growth. In this work a new methodology for producing highly
crystalline, size controlled ZnONS using a chemical microwave assisted synthetic
route is described. A wide range of sizes and shapes of ZnONS could be
controlled by varying the molar ratio of zinc nitrate to hexamethylenetetramine
HMT from 3:20 to 30:20. The produced ZnONS systematically changed from 25 nm
spherical nanoparticles to well-shaped micro sized hexagonal nanorods.
Pronounced oxygen defects were also noticed, particularly at higher molar
ratios. However, this is not the case with the lattice constant c, whose value
is found to decrease by increasing this ratio. The produced ZnONS were tested as
antimicrobial agent against Gram-negative E. coli, Gram-positive B. subtilis
bacteria and yeast S. cerevisiae. Significant inhibition of these microbial
strains was noticed even at low concentrations of ZnONS. The ZnONS with the
molar ratio 3:20 was the most effective against the microbes tested. The results
showed 80, 71 and 50% inhibition of E. coli, B. subtilis and S. cerevisiae,
respectively. Using the "surfactant stress model" we describe the nanostructure
formation of ZnONS. The antimicrobial activity of ZnONS correlated well with
lattice constant c and particle size, where smaller particles with higher value
of c displayed increase inhibitory activity. No clear correlation between the
oxygen defects and bacterial inhibitions was observed. This highly crystalline,
size tunable ZnONS could prove to be effective antimicrobial agents at low
concentrations e.g. 20 g per 10 mL and might be tested against other
microorganisms.

A hybrid method of ultrafast laser dicing and high density plasma etching with
water soluble mask for thin silicon wafer cutting. Future silicon wafers are
getting thinner in semiconductor industry to satisfy the requirement of
miniaturizing package size in mobile device applications. Development of thin
wafers is the mutual goal of current semiconductor researches. In this paper, a
novel method incorporating the convenience of laser ablation and speed of plasma
etching is proposed to replace traditional mechanical dicing saw for thin wafer
cutting. The main idea is to use laser to create patterns on the silicon wafer
coated with water soluble protection material and the unprotected area is
exposed to the high-density plasma which is later etched through. This study
includes development of the water-soluble protecting mask material, design of
inductively coupled plasma ICP and microwave plasma sources, pattern scribing
utilizing ultrafast laser, and trial of an etching Bosch process associated with
the high-density plasma chamber to create high aspect ratio trench. The
polyvinyl alcohol PVA based protecting material has excellent solubility and is
extremely easy to be rinsed by water. With appropriately added chemicals,
optical absorption is improved for laser ablation. A 532nm 10 pico-second laser
is used to perform surface scribing with minimal recast and heat affected zone
HAZ at the edges. Good plasma homogeneity is demonstrated in the designed 12
microwave and ICP chambers. With the protection coating the silicon wafer can be
etched at 7.2m/min rate and 10.11 etch selectivity by the microwave and ICP
sources in the chamber. Finally, etching process trials are performed, and the
results show that deep and high aspect ratio trenches ~15m wide, ~95m deep can
be achieved which is fully acceptable for wafers under 100m thickness.

Damping capacity of the Al matrix composite reinforced with SiC particle and
TiNi fiber. Imitating the structure of steel-reinforced concrete, a composite
coupling good damping capacity and mechanical property was fabricated by
pressure infiltration progress. The aluminum Al matrix composite was hybrid
reinforced by 20% volume fraction of SiC particle SiC p and 20% volume fraction
of TiNi fiber TiNi f . The damping capacity of the composite in the temperature
range from to was studied using a dynamic mechanical analyzer DMA. Due to the
B19B2 reverse martensitic transformation in TiNi f , a damping peak showed up in
the heating process. Furthermore, both the hysteretic effect of the
martensite/variants interfaces in TiNi f and the weak bonding interface between
SiC p and TiNi f were attributed to the high damping capacity of the composite.
After tension deformation, a compressive stress was formed in the composite in
the heating process. With the help of compressive stress, the value of the
damping peak was much higher than before, since the movement of dislocation in
the Al matrix was easier.

Adaptability of Polymer-Containing Sewage Corrosion Inhibitor. The polymer
content in the produced water from Tuoliu Station is about 20 mg/L. Cationic
imidazoline-type corrosion inhibitor is used to corrosion control of sewage. The
corrosion inhibitor can react with the negatively charged materials such as
anionic polymer and suspended substance by adsorption and merging to form
complex aggregates, so that the suspended solids content increases, resulting in
suspended solids content of exported sewage has been high. So a new type of non-
ionic corrosion inhibitor has been developed and field trials have been
performed. The results show that non-ionic corrosion inhibitor can effectively
reduce the suspended solids content of wastewater while ensuring the corrosion
rate of wastewater.

Durability of nanosized oxygen-barrier coatings on polymers. Research on silicon
oxide thin films developed as gas-barrier protection for polymer-based
components is reviewed, with attention paid to the relations between i coating
defects, cohesive strength and internal stress state, and ii interfacial
interactions and related adhesion to the substrate. The deposition process of
the oxide from a vapor or a plasma phase leads in both cases to the formation of
covalent bonds between the two materials, with high adhesion levels. The oxide
coating contains nanoscopic defects and microscopic flaws, and their respective
effect on the barrier performance and mechanical resistance of the coating is
analyzed. Potential improvements are discussed, including the control of
internal stresses in the coating during deposition. Controlled levels of
compressive internal stresses in the coating are beneficial to both the barrier
performance and the mechanical reliability of the coated polymer. An optimal
coating thickness, with low oxygen permeation and high cohesive strength, is
determined from experimental and theoretical analyses of the failure mechanisms
of the coating under mechanical load. These investigations are found relevant to
tailor the interactions and stress state in the interfacial region, in order to
improve the reliability of the coating/substrate assembly.

Investigations on structural, optical and magnetic properties of solution-
combustion-synthesized nanocrystalline iron molybdate. Iron molybdate -Fe2MoO43
nanoparticles were synthesized by exploiting the self-propagating high-
temperature combustion strategy using hexamine as a fuel. The obtained -Fe2MoO43
nanoparticles exhibited the orthorhombic crystalline structure, which is
evidenced from the XRD pattern. FT-IR spectrum revealed the existence of
stretching and bending vibrations of MoOMo and OMoO bonding in the nanocrystals.
The binding energy peaks in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS spectrum
positioned at 710 and 725, 231 and 235 and 530 eV, respectively, correspond to
the Fe2p, Mo3d and O1s orbitals. Absorption spectrum of nanoparticles showed
adequate absorbance of visible region photons of the nanoparticles and also
optical bandgap value of -Fe2MoO43 nanoparticles as 2.26 eV, which is calculated
using the KubelkaMunk function. The existence of Fe3+ and Mo6+ in -Fe2MoO43 is
authenticated with the aid of electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum
measurements. The obtained nanoparticles have showed methylene blue dye
degradation of 98.4% under sunlight irradiation.

Elastic Work and Fracture Energy of Concretes Made with Crushed Stones and
Pebbles Aggregates. This work examines the elastic work and fracture energy of a
mortar and two concretes using the wedge splitting method to attain stable crack
propagation. A comparison was made of the fracture energy in mortar and concrete
using two different aggregates: crushed stone and pebbles, both with sizes
between 4.8 and 9.5 mm. The mortar was made of sand, Portland cement and water,
using a cement: sand ratio of 1:2. The water content was 0.46 of the cement
mass. The samples were molded and then cured for seven days at in 100% relative
humidity. After curing, the samples were dried at for 48 hours. The concretes
were produced using the same procedure, but with the addition of the aggregates.
The amount of aggregate was 10 wt.% of the total weight of cement plus sand.
After curing and drying, the samples were subjected to the wedge splitting
procedure. The tests were carried out at a constant displacement rate of 0.030
mm/min. The following results were obtained: elastic work: 80.4 0.6, 114 9 and
110 12 mJ, and fracture energy: 30.3 0.6, 40 1, and 40 5 J.m-2, respectively,
for the mortar and for the concretes containing crushed stone and pebbles. These
results allow us to conclude that the aggregates improved the elastic work and
the fracture energy of the concretes. However, the type of aggregate did not
make any difference to the properties. These findings contradict what is
generally known,e., that concrete produced with pebbles is inferior to concrete
made with crushed stone, at least insofar as it concerns the energies associated
with the fracture process.

Large amplitude free vibration analysis of functionally graded beams using an
homogenisation procedure. The purpose of the present paper is to show that the
problem of geometrically non linear free vibrations of functionally graded FG
beams with immovable ends can be reduced to that of isotropic homogeneous beams
with effective bending stiffness and axial stiffness parameters. The material
properties of the functionally graded composites examined are assumed to be
graded in the thickness direction and estimated through the rule of mixture. The
theoretical model is based on the Euler-Bernouilli beam theory and the Von
Karman geometrical nonlinearity assumptions. An homogenization procedure is
developed using the governing axial equation of the beam in which the axial
inertia and damping are ignored. Hamiltons principle is applied and a multimode
approach is derived to calculate the fundamental nonlinear frequency parameters,
which are found to be in a good agreement with the published results. The non-
dimensional curvatures associated to the nonlinear fundamental mode are also
given in the case of clamped-clamped FG beams.

The Effect of Activator to Binder Ratio on the Compressive Strength of Fly Ash
Based Geopolymer Mortar in Sulphate Environment. One of the significant
characteristic material needed to consider is durability. Sulphate ion contained
in soil is one of aggressive agents that could cause degradation of concrete
members which led to loss of compressive strength. The current research is to
elaborate the effect of activator to binder ratio on the compressive strength of
the fly ash based geopolymer mortar in the sulphate environment. Two different
types of geopolymer mortar were castedmortar made of 100% fly ash and mortar
contained 95% fly ash + 5% slaked lime. The fly ash used in this research is
classified as F fly ash from the Mpanau power plant the variation of activator
to binder ratio of 0. 40; 0. 50; and 0. 60, and water/solid ratio variations of
0. 32, 0. 34 and 0. 36. The composition of sulfuric acid was by 5% of the sample
volume. Geopolymers mortar compressive strength test is conducted on the
immersed samples in a solution of 5% sulfuric acid with age of 0, 7, 14, 28, 56,
and 84 days, respectively. The compressive strength test results showed that the
highest compressive strength of geopolymers mortar resistant to sulfuric acid
attack was geopolymers mortar made from fly ash with activator to binder ratio
0. 60, water / solid ratio 0. 32, and percentage of lime to binder 5% at the age
of 84 days.

Effect of water vapor pressure on positive and negative tone electron-beam
patterning of polymethyl methacrylate. Variable-pressure electron-beam
lithography VP-EBL employs an ambient gas at subatmospheric pressures to reduce
charging during electron-beam lithography. VP-EBL has been previously shown to
eliminate pattern distortion and provide improved resolution when patterning
polymethyl methacrylate PMMA on insulating substrates. However, it remains
unknown how water vapor affects the contrast and clearing dose nor has the
effect of water vapor on the negative-tone behavior of PMMA been studied. In
addition, water vapor has recently been shown to alter the radiation chemistry
of the VP-EBL process for Teflon AF. Such changes in radiation chemistry have
not been explored for PMMA. In this work, VP-EBL was conducted on conductive
substrates to study the effect of water vapor on PMMA patterning separately from
the effects of charge dissipation. In addition, both positive and negative-tone
processes were studied to determine the effect of water vapor on both chain
scission and cross-linking. The contrast of PMMA was found to improve
significantly with increasing water vapor pressure for both positive and
negative-tone patterning. The clearing dose for positive-tone patterning
increases moderately with vapor pressure as would be expected for electron
scattering in a gas. However, the onset set dose for negative-tone patterning
increased dramatically with pressure revealing a more significant change in the
exposure mechanism. X-ray photoelectron spectra and infrared transmission
spectra indicate that water vapor only slightly alters the composition of
exposed PMMA. Also, electron scattering in water vapor yielded a much larger
clear region around negative-tone patterns. This effect could be useful for
increasing the range of the developed region around cross-linked PMMA beyond the
backscattered electron range. Thus, VP-EBL for PMMA introduces a new means of
tuning clearing/onset dose and contrast, while allowing additional control over
the size of the cleared region around negative-tone patterns.

Flexible, solution-processed, indium oxide In2O3 thin film transistors TFT and
circuits for internet-of-things IoT. Over the last decade, novel approaches to
explore low voltage flexible devices and low power flexible circuits are being
widely researched by the scientific community. To realize the true potential of
energy thrifty Internet-of-Things IoT objects, low power circuits and hence
their low-voltage operating devices are a paramount prerequisite, especially
when their power is constrained by autonomous energy scavenging. At present,
through advanced manufacturing processes, silicon-based semiconductor devices
are powering the modern electronics industry. However, processing temperatures
are inhibiting them from flexible and printed electronics, as well as being too
costly for scalability to the trillions of IoT objects anticipated. Therefore,
development of solution-processed metal oxide semiconductors creates huge
opportunities for IoT and wearables. Here, flexible solution-processed indium
oxide In2O3 thin film transistors TFT and inverter circuits with low operating
voltage are reported. The operating voltage of theis 3 V with threshold voltage
V th 0.82 V, on/off ratio 10 5 and extracted mobility in saturation regime is

Titanium Nitride Deposition in Titanium Implant Alloys Produced by Powder
Metallurgy. Titanium nitride TiN is an extremely hard material, often used as a
coating on titanium alloy, steel, carbide, and aluminum components to improve
wear resistance. Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition EB-PVD is a form of
deposition in which a target anode is bombarded with an electron beam given off
by a charged tungsten filament under high vacuum, producing a thin film in a
substrate. In this work are presented results of TiN deposition in targets and
substrates of TiC.P. and Ti-13Nb-13Zr obtained by powder metallurgy. Samples
were produced by mixing of hydrided metallic powders followed by uniaxial and
cold isostatic pressing with subsequent densification by sintering between up

Sintered samples were characterized for phase composition, microstructure and
microhardness by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Vickers
indentation, respectively. It was shown that the samples were sintered to high
densities and presented homogeneous microstructure, with ideal characteristics
for an adequate deposition and adherence. The film layer presented a continuous

Nanoindentation of model diamond nanocomposites: Hierarchical molecular dynamics
and finite-element simulations. Complementary molecular dynamics MD and finite-
element FE simulations of model diamond nanocomposites MDN subjected to
nanoindentation were undertaken to understand how contact behavior pertaining to
the surface morphology of MDN surfaces can be spanned from the molecular to the
continuum scale. The MD simulations determined that the behavior inside the
contact region is influenced by atomic-scale features on the tip and surface,
indent location, grain tilt and roughness of the MDN surfaces. In addition, if
the atomic-scale surface morphology is treated as a surface roughness within the
FE simulations, the same grain orientations, and similar elastic properties are
used for both MD and FE simulations, there is reasonable agreement between the
contact pressures for relatively low indentation loads and shallow substrates.
For larger loads, the contact pressures from the FE simulations deviate somewhat
from the MD results near the center of the contact. The contact behavior for
length scales that are prohibitive for MD models e.g., deep substrates was also
examined using FE simulations. This allowed for a detailed investigation of how
contact conditions and stick-slip events within the contact evolve as a function
of contact pressure and continuum surface stresses.

grain size, where grain refinement of AA7068 matrix byreached saturation point
for 0.5wt%. The average ultimate tensile strength UTS of the specimens before
and after extrusion processes and T6 heat treatment increases from 263MPa to

resistance of the AA7068 alloy and its nanocomposite with 0.5wt%in T6 conditions

indicate thatup to 0.5wt% are effective in improving the mechanical properties

measurement times in the order of minutes are characteristic for this method,
and it is possible to simultaneously analyse all elements from II to U. The GD-
OES is therefore well suited for the analysis of graded coatings as well as

Alginate/gelatin blended hydrogel fibers cross-linked by Ca2+ and oxidized
starch: Preparation and properties. Alginate/gelatin blended hydrogel fibers
were successfully prepared based on sodium alginate cross-linked by Ca2+ and
gelatin cross-linked by oxidized starch through the wet spinning process. The
structure, surface morphologies, swelling properties of alginate hydrogel fibers
and alginate/gelatin blended hydrogel fibers were examined by Fourier transform
infrared analysis FTIR, cross-linking degree test, element analysis test and
scanning electron microscopy SEM. While mechanical properties test, water
absorption and retention properties test provide the mechanical, water
absorption and retention properties. FTIR, cross-linking degree and element
analysis results indicate that there is gelatin remaining in alginate/gelatin
blended hydrogel fibers. However, the cross-linking of gelatin by oxidized
starch is not completed with some dissociative gelatin solvated in the
coagulation bath. Among the mentioned fibers, FS10G2 is the best to improve the
properties of alginate/gelatin blended hydrogel fibers with an optimal mass
ratio of sodium and gelatin. The excessive additive amount of gelatin leads to
the aggregation of gelatin in alginate/gelatin blended hydrogel fibers, making
the worse compatibility between alginate and gelatin. It also destroys the
mechanical properties of alginate/gelatin blended hydrogel fibers. These
alginate/gelatin blended hydrogel fibers might have a potential application in
the biomedical fields.

Effect of carboxymethyl cellulose on the flow behavior of lithium-ion battery
anode slurries and the electrical as well as mechanical properties of
corresponding dry layers. We present a holistic view on the role of polymeric
binders in waterborne LiB anodes, including preparation and processing of wet
slurries as well as microstructure, electrical conductivity and mechanical
integrity of dry electrode layers. We focus on carboxymethyl cellulose CMC, with
respect to technical application the influence of soft, nano-particulate
styrenebutadiene rubber SBR as secondary binder is also addressed. We discuss
the influence of CMC concentration, molecular weight M w and degree of
substitution DS on flow behavior of anode slurries. Rheological data are not
only relevant for processing, here we use them to characterize the adsorption of
CMC on active material particles and dispersion of these particles in the slurry
at technically relevant concentrations. The fraction of CMC adsorbed onto
graphite particles increases with increasing M w and decreasing DS. Electrical
conductivity increases with M w ,e. with decreasing free polymer deteriorating
conductive carbon black pathways. CMC does not contribute to the adhesion of
electrode layers, irrespective of M w or DS, technically feasible adhesion is
inferred by SBR. Cohesive strength of anode layers, determined here for the
first time under well-defined mechanical load, increases with increasing M w and
decreasing DS,e. with increasing fraction of adsorbed CMC and corresponding
improved particle dispersion. Strong cohesion and high electrical conductivity
are correlated to an alignment of graphite particles as revealed by electron
microscopy, presumably enabled by higher particle mobility in well-dispersed
slurries. Accordingly, targeted choice of CMC is a valuable means to control
processing, electrical conductivity and mechanical strength of LiB electrodes.

Design of a Heat Exchanger Made of Gravity Heat Pipes with an Enlarged Heat
Exchange Surface for Heat Dissipation from the Electrical Cabinet. Due to the
great progress in the electronics industry, heat management in electronic
components is becoming a serious and important problem. Cooling of electronic
components ensures a lower occurrence of failure of elements, longer service
life of the device, protection against overheating of elements, further prevents
malfunction of the device and loss of heat. In many cases, heat dissipation by
natural convection is often insufficient. Heat dissipation by forced convection
is effective, but it carries the risk of clogging the interior of the electrical
cabinet with dust, which can negatively affect the functionality of the
electrical elements over time. One of the possibilities of efficient heat
dissipation from the electrical cabinet without forced convection is by means of
heat pipe technology, which uses a phase change of the working substance for
heat transfer. The article deals with the design, construction and experimental
determination of the performance of gravity heat tubes with an increased heat
exchange area suitable for the design of an electrical cabinet heat exchanger.

Direct ink writing of porous titanium Ti6Al4V lattice structures. Ti6Al4V
components, for biomedical and aerospace sectors, are receiving a great interest
especially after the advent of additive manufacturing technologies. The most
used techniques are Selective Laser Sintering SLS, Selective Laser Melting SLM
and Electron Beam Melting EBM. In the current research, we developed 3D-printed
Ti6Al4V scaffolds by Direct Ink Writing DIW technology. Appropriate ink
formulations, based on water-titanium powder suspensions, were achieved by
controlling the rheological properties of the developed inks. After printing
process, and drying, the printed components were sintered at under high vacuum
for 3 h. Highly porous titanium scaffolds with porosity up to 65 vol% were
produced and different geometries were printed. The influence of the porosity on
the morphology, compression strength and biocompatibility of the scaffolds was
investigated.

Thermo-mechanical stability of forged Ti-25Al-11Nb at.%. Dynamic material
modeling DMM has been applied to the analysis of the mechanical behavior of a
Widmanstatten + primary 2 + Ti-25Al-11Nb alloy to establish the flow stress-
strain rate-temperature-strain criteria for stable flow. Unstable and stable
flow regimes predicted by DMM were correlated to microstructural observations.
Unstable flow zones were related to transformation of orthorhombic O2 , kinking
of the 2 lamellae, shear band formation and coarsening of the dynamically
recrystallized grain structure; stable flow regimes were shown to be associated
with dissolution of the Widmanstatten 2, coarsening of primary 2 and dynamic
spheroidization of the lamellar 2 microconstituents.

Critical impact of gate dielectric interfaces on the trap states and cumulative
charge of high-performance organic thin field transistors. In the operation of
the electrical properties are strongly dependent on the merits of the
constituting layers and the formed interfaces. Here we study the trap states
variations at the interface between the organic semiconductor pentacene and
polymer insulators. With ZrO2 dielectric modified by polymers and find a 10
decrease in the density of trap states at the semiconductor/insulator interface,
bring about the charge carrier mobility increase from 0.058cm2/Vs to
0.335cm2/Vs. In addition, when compare to the thicker films at the same applied
gate voltage, the thinner film would lead to enhanced coupling capability and
more charges cumulative cumulated at the channel region, which is pivotal for
optimizing the performance of The results prove that the property of the
insulator layer could impact largely on the device performance.

Nonionic emulsion-mediated synthesis of zeolite beta. Zeolite beta synthesis was
first carried out in a newly developed emulsion system containing nonionic
polyoxyethylated alkylphenol surfactant, which showed interesting non-
conventional features. Compared to the conventional hydrothermal synthesis of
zeolite beta, the reported nonionic emulsion system showed a faster nucleation
rate. Furthermore, the emulsion system could stabilize the beta product and
retarded its further transformation to ZSM-5 even under the high crystallization
temperature at. Additionally, the beta particle size could be tuned by the
adoption of different lengths of alkyl chain in the surfactant and cosurfactant.
Control experiments showed each emulsion component played a crucial role in the
zeolite beta growth. The approach proposed in this paper might be extended to
apply for the syntheses of other types of zeolites with particle size under
control.

Chemical polishing of samples obtained by selective laser melting from titanium
alloy Ti6Al4V. The paper discusses a method of chemical polishing of Ti6Al4V
samples and presents the results of our study. The samples were produced by
selective laser melting, which is an increasingly popular method of producing
thin-walled, geometrically complex products. The document analyzes how polishing
with solutions featuring a varying content of hydrofluoric and nitric acids
affects the etching rate and alters the superficial roughness of the samples in
both the longitudinal and the transverse directions. We have thus formulated the
recommendations on the optimum composition and concentration of such acidic
solutions for polishing Ti6Al4V products made by selective laser melting.

Effect of linking arm hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature, length and end-group on
the conformation and the RGD accessibility of surface-immobilized fibronectin.
In order to stimulate the cellular response to implant materials, extracellular
matrix ECM proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin FN, are immobilized on the
implant surface. Amongst all ECM proteins used for biomimetic materials for
medical applications, FN is one of the most investigated proteins thanks to its
ability to promote cell adhesion and its contribution to important physiological
processes. However, its conformation and hence its bioactivity strongly depend
on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of the surface as well as on
immobilization strategies. This work investigates the effect of these two
parameters, as well as the effect of the crosslinker length. FN was grafted onto
silicon wafers using eights different linking arms presenting different lengths,
hydrophilic/hydrophobic characters and binding sites. The protein was linked
through either its amino groups lysine amino acids or sulfhydryl functionalities
cysteine amino acids. The grafting of each crosslinker and subsequent FN
conjugation onto the surfaces was evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
while the surface hydrophilicity was determined by contact angle measurements.
Moreover, atomic force microscopy images revealed that the conformation of
surface conjugated FN only depends on the hydrophilicity of the linking arm. The
FN conformation was also probed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ELISA.
ELISA data demonstrated that all of the three investigated parameters linking
arm parameter length, hydrophobic/hydrophilic character, and terminal end-group
somewhat influence the RGD accessibility.

the calculation of strain energy distribution at crack tip. The experimental
part of the work is devoted to the study of the temperature evolution at crack
tip with high spatial and time resolution. The thermodynamic measurement was
combined with study of strain field at crack tip based on the digital image

Optical and water repellant properties of Ag/SnO2 bilayer thin films. The
optical and water repellant properties of single layer and bilayer films of Ag
and SnO2 deposited on glass substrates by thermal evaporation have been
reported. Ag/SnO2 bilayers were deposited in two sequences wherein the
deposition of SnO2 layer was followed by Ag deposition and vice versa. X-ray
diffraction studies show that the Ag films crystallize in the FCC structure and
SnO2 is amorphous, while atomic force microscopy images indicate the formation
of large clusters of the order of 12 nm. The single layer Ag films exhibit
localized surface plasmon resonance LSPR that shifts from visible region to the
infrared with increase in thickness from 5 to 12 nm. It is observed that, only
the Ag films of thickness 8 nm exhibits LSPR peak whereas the critical thickness
is 5 nm for Ag/SnO2 films. A blue shift is observed in the LSPR peak position
when the SnO2 layer caps the Ag film. Whereas, the LSPR of Ag is suppressed
significantly when the SnO2 layer is introduced between the glass and the Ag
film and also when Ag and SnO2 were co-evaporated. Water repellant properties
indicate that the pure Ag film has an average contact angle of 104o which
decreases to 100o when SnO2 caps the Ag layer and 97o when Ag is deposited on
top of the SnO2 buffer layer. Co-evaporated AgSnO2 films show a contact angle of
93o.

light color gives more information about the living cell object. The histograms
confirm vigorously these results, so this could solve and enhanced the

Preparation of Regenerated Cathode Material Lithium Nickel Cobalt Oxide
LiNi0.7Co0.3O2Form Spent Lithium-Ion Battery. With the development of new energy
vehicles, urgent issues have attracted considerable attention. Some power
batteries have entered the scrapping period, with the imperative recycling of
used power batteries. Some studies have predicted that by 2020, the amount of
power lithium battery scrap will reach 32.2 GWh, corresponding to ~500,000 tons,
and by 2023, the scrap will reach 101 GWh, corresponding to ~1.16 million tons.
In this study, nickel-cobalt-lithium LiNio 0.3 O2 cathode materials are
regenerated from spent lithium-ion battery cathode materials as the raw
material, which not only aids in the reduction of pressure on the environment
but also leads to the recycling of resources. First, extraction is employed
using extracting agent p204 to remove aluminum ions from an acid leaching
solution. Extraction conditions for aluminum ions are: include a phase ratio of
1:2,a pH of 3, an extractant concentration of 30%, and a saponification rate of
70%.Next, the precursor was prepared by co-precipitation using sodium hydroxide
and ammonia water as the precipitant and complexion agents, respectively; hence,
the cathode material can be uniformly mixed at the atomic level. The precursor
and lithium hydroxide were subjected to calcination at high temperature using a
high-temperature solid-phase method. The Calcination conditions include an air
atmosphere ; a calcination temperature of ; a calcination time of 15 h, an n
precursor: n lithium hydroxide ratio of 1:1.1.The Thermogravimetric analysis
revealed that the synthesis temperature should not exceed. X-ray diffraction
analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and energy spectrum analysis of the
cathode material revealed a composition comprising Li, Ni, and Co oxides. After
analysis, the material obtained is lithium nickel-cobalt-oxide, LiN i0.7 Co0.3O2
, which is a positive electrode material with good crystallinity and a regular
layered structure.

A physically-based high temperature yield strength model forr steels. The
strength ofr steels, which is controlled by chemical composition and
microstructure, evolves significantly under high temperature loading. This paper
presents a temperature-independent, physically-based model for evolving yield
strength, including the interdependent effects of dislocations, solutes,
precipitates and grain boundaries. The key roles of solute and precipitate
strengthening inr steels are successfully demonstrated. The measured significant
beneficial effect of up to 3wt% tungsten on solute strengthening, and hence,
yield strength are successfully predicted. The new model demonstrates that the
reported strength reduction inr-3W alloys under thermal aging can be primarily
attributed to Laves phase formation and associated depletion of tungsten
solutes, consistent with microstructural observations.

The effect of variation of microstructure on fracture mechanics parameters of
HSLA-100 steel. The variations in the FCGR curve, the JR curve, the blunting-
line slope and the stretch zone width SZW for systematic variation of
microstructure in Cu-strengthened HSLA-100 steel has been studied. The
microstructural variation in the steel has been introduced through ageing at
various temperatures after an initial quenching treatment. This has resulted in
progressive tempering of the as-quenched martensitic matrix, accompanied by
nanoscale precipitation of coherent Cu particles that gradually coarsen and
loose coherency with overageing. It was observed that although there was a
systematic trend, the FCGR curves were least sensitive to microstructural
changes. The variation of fracture toughness, characterized by JQ in most cases
and by KQ for the microstructures displaying highest strengths, correlated well
with the inverse relationship between fracture toughness and strength. A
systematic trend was also observed for the pre-exponent and exponent of the
power-law tearing curve for cases in which brittle fracture was precluded, the
blunting-line slope and the SZW. The effect of coherency of precipitates in
restricting plastic flow, as implied from the variation of mechanical properties
with ageing temperature is thought to be responsible for the effects observed.

Research on the Influence of Shields to Thermal Equilibrium of CNC Machine Tool.
In order to investigate that shields have the effect on the thermal equilibrium
of CNC machine tool, this paper applies the theory of heat transfer and finite
element analysis to analyze the thermal characteristics of CNC lathe CK40A/1000.
By ANSYS software, the temperature distributions of spindle engine, headstock
and bearing at thermal equilibrium with/without shields are obtained. By
analyzing thermal equilibrium patterns and experiments, the temperature of
spindle bearings with shields arehigher than without shields at thermal
equilibrium. And shields have less influence on the temperature gradient of tool
inner thermal sources.

Composite Materials. Computational Analysis of Deep-Drawing for Composite
Materials Considering the Microstructure. II. Deep-Drawing Simulation of Knitted
Fabric Reinforced Thermoplastics by Homogenization Theory and Experimental
Verification.. A novel computational method for deep-drawing simulation of
composite materials has been proposed with taking a three-dimensional continuum
mechanics approach. The most notable feature is the consideration of micromacro
coupling effects by the mathematical homogenization theory. The homogenized
properties and the constitutive law are evaluated carefully using the three-
dimensional microstructure model under the large deformation and biaxial loading
conditions. In this paper, the knit reinforcement of aramid fiber is studied,
which has very complex microstructure architecture. The polypropylene is used as
the matrix. The newly developed deep-drawing simulation provides us the
macroscopic deformation, strain, stress and stiffness distribution as well as
the largely deformed microstructures in the deep-drawn product. The high-speed
computing technique which has been developed in the previous report enables us
to carry out the micro-macro coupled nonlinear analysis easily on the personal
computer. The experimental work has also been conducted, and the largely
deformed microstructures are compared between experiment and simulation. A good
coincident was obtained, which implies the validity and reliability of the
proposed computational method.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopic Investigations of the Corrosion
Behaviour of Brass Alloys in Aqueous Solutions. Brass alloys are technologically
important materials due to the wide range of their industrial applications.
Extensive efforts have been directed to investigate the corrosion and stability
of these alloys. The corrosion behaviour ofthese materials is always related to
the study of the dezincification process or the selective dissolution of the
active components of the alloy in the different media under different
conditions. Due to the lack of systematic study of the electrochemical behaviour
of these alloys in aqueous solutions at different pH, it was found essential to
cover this area Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS and polarization
techniques, are powerful to investigate the electrochemical processes occuring
at the electrode / electrolyte interface. The techniques enables mechanistic
studies beside corrosion rate determination. In this work, the corrosion and
passivation behaviours of three different brass alloys in aqueous solutions of
various pH, covering the acidic, neutral and basic media were studied and a
comparison with the corrosion behaviour of the pure elements under the same
conditions made. EIS and polarization techniques beside open circuit potential
measurements were used. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS and scanning
electron microscopy SEM were employed to explain and to confirm the corrosion
phenomena occuring at the alloy surface. Preliminary data have shown that the
selective dissolution of Zn and Pb from the alloys under open circuit conditions
occur in acidic and basic media more than in neutral solutions and the behaviour
cannot be explained on the basis of pure pH effects.

Prevention of intra-abdominal adhesion using electrospun PEG/PLGA nanofibrous
membranes. The use of physical barriers, such as nanofiber membranes, is a
potential method to prevent adhesion formation after surgery. In this study, we
fabricated electrospun composite polyethylene glycol PEG/polylactic-co-glycolic
PLGA nanofibrous membrane to prevent abdomen adhesion; this composite acts as a
barrier between cecum and the surrounding tissues without interrupting mass
transfer and cecum healing. PEG/PLGA nanofibrous membranes consisting of 0% P0,
5% P1, 10% P2, 15% P3, 20% P4, and 25% P5PEG were prepared, and their
physicochemical properties were characterized. The P0 shows the highest
thermostability, whereas P1 exhibited the most homogenous morphology, the
narrowest diameter distribution, and the largest ultimate stress and strain. In
vitro cell adhesion and proliferation tests using fibroblasts indicate that all
nanofibrous membranes inhibited cell proliferation, with P1 showing the lowest
degree of cell attachment. In vivo application of nanofibrous membranes on the
repaired site of rat cecum model demonstrated that all of the membranes prevent
adhesion formation to a certain extent. We concluded based on gross observation,
histological analysis, and functional assays that P1 served as an effective
anti-adhesion membrane after cecum surgery in a clinical setting.

of materials should be considered when ultrasonic frequency was used in the high

Frequency effect on fatigue properties was reviewed for three metallic
materials, such as steel alloy, titanium alloy and aluminum alloy, in aspect of
crack growth rate and fracture surface analysis. Diversity of the frequency

Properties of bcc metals by tight-binding total energy simulations.
Monovacancies of six bcc d-transition metals V, Cr, Nb, Mo, Ta and W have been
studied by tight-binding TB simulations using the NRL-TB method. This method
satisfactorily reproduces the electronic properties, phonon frequencies, thermal
expansion coefficients and atomic mean-squared displacements for pure bulk
systems. The TB method shows that for group-V metals the atoms in the first
neighbor shell of the vacancy relax inward by about 5% and lose charge from d
orbitals, while second neighbor shell atoms relax outward by about 1%. For
group-VI metals both first and second neighbor shells relax inward and gain d
orbital charge, and for Mo and W the relaxation is in fact stronger for the
second than the first neighbor shell. These results are not significantly
affected by the use of charge self-consistent terms in the TB model. The
structural and charge transfer changes are accompanied by new energy bands at
selected k-points for group-VI while they cover the whole Brillouin zone BZ for
the group-V metals. Comparison to first-principles calculations for one example,
Nb, shows good agreement for the presence of new energy bands as well as the
charge and structural relaxation of the first and second neighbor shells.

Synthesis and Properties of a Polymer-Modified Material for Thin Spray-On Liners
in Mine Roadways. In order to adapt to dry and wet environment in mine roadways
and improve the performance of sealing materials under different environmental
conditions, this study selected the materials based on their ability to spray
and found that the materials with a viscosity of 15006000 MPas can achieve a
balance between performance of spray and wall-hanging performance. Next, by
selecting high-elastic polyacrylate emulsion and ordinary Portland cement as the
film-forming agent and gel, respectively, mix proportion factors of the
nonreactive thin spray-on liner TSL were analyzed by using the Taguchi method.
Moreover, fluidity, setting time, sealing properties, compressive strength,
bending strength, and bonding strength of those materials were measured. It was
disclosed that addition of an appropriate amount of polyacrylate emulsion can
enhance the effects of fibers. By observing the morphologies of the materials
bonding surfaces and comparing the factors influencing bonding strength between
both dry and wet walls, it was uncovered that the adhesive property of cement-
based sealing materials was mainly affected by the water-cement ratio.
Eventually, bonding strength and sealing properties were selected as primary
optimization indexes, while setting time, bending strength, and compressive
strength were selected as secondary optimization indexes. The appropriate
proportions of two types offor dry and wet walls were W/C = 50%; P/C = 6%; F/C =
1%; T/C = 0.2% and W/C = 45%; P/C = 6%; F/C = 1%; T/C = 0.4%, respectively. A
prepared TSL can be used for filling rock fractures in mine roadways. In
addition, TSL exhibited a great performance for dry and wet walls under
different environmental conditions. The present study may provide an insightful
guidance and reference for the investigation of TSL sealing materials applied in
the mine roadways.

Optimization of the substrate temperature of narrow bandgap CIS solar cells by
three stage coevaporation process. In this paper, three-stage co-evaporation
method was used to prepare narrow bandgap CuInSe2CIS thin-film absorber. The
effect of the substrate temperature on the performance of CIS solar cells was
investigated. The substrate temperatures of the CIS films varied from to. The
microstructure structure, crystallinity, morphology, and optoelectrical
performances of the CIS solar cell were investigated by various characterization
methods. We found that the substrate temperature played a great role in the
properties of the CIS thin films and solar cell devices: that was the CIS solar
cell deposited at low temperature showed poor crystallinity, fine grain size and
low efficiency, while CIS solar cell deposited very high temperature also showed
high efficiency. However, high substrate temperature can lead to the Indium loss
at the surface of the CIS films, although the bulk composition of CIS films did
vary much at different substrate, resulting in FF fill factor reduce.

Diffusion Bonding of Aluminum Alloy Using a High-Boiling Liquid Protection. This
paper presents a diffusion bonding technology at vacuum using a high-boiling
liquid protection, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether C6H19O3. After washing in
alcohol, the specimens were immersed in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether. Before
heating, the vacuum chamber was vacuumized to about 10-1Pa. Then chamber was
heated to about, and held for 20 minute to evaporate the liquid protection in
order to make the clean bonding surfaces contact. Metallographic observations of
the interface by optical microscope were carried out. The experimental results
show that the protections have successfully protected the bonding surfaces from
re-oxidation prior to bonding. The metallographs show that the vacancies at the
bonding interface bonding at for 2 hours are obvious and the materials at the
interfaces of specimens bonded under the pressure of 5 MPa at for 2 hours were
well joined.

Ferroelectric phase transition and soft-mode behavior in BaxSr1xTiO3: a refined
treatment of a quasi-harmonic model. The composition and temperature dependences
of the soft-mode and ferroelectric phase transition in BaxSr1?xTiO3 BST are
presented and analyzed within the framework of a refined treatment of a quasi-
harmonic model QHM for quantum particles. The QHM involves generalized simple
microscopic quantum particles with anharmonic on-site double-Morse-type
potential and harmonic interactions. The theory uses the variational principle
scheme at finite temperature in the mean-field approximation while taking into
account the predominant mass effect, the cell volume effect as well as
ferroelectric distortion. The soft-mode frequency and the Ba concentration x
dependence of the ferroelectric phase transition temperature are analyzed and
show good agreement with experimental results throughout the full x range
0???x???1. It is found that BST is paraelectric below the critical impurity
concentration xc?=?0.01 with a softening of the soft mode. It becomes
ferroelectric above this critical concentration x???xc, and as the impurity
concentration increases the predominant displacive soft-mode behavior stiffens
in the ferroelectric phase with much less softening in crystals indicating a
possible phase change at high x. Around x?c?=?0.5, Tc deviates gradually from
linear behavior with a rather slight round stagnation which might characterize
an equilibrium ?region? where several ferroelectric phases coexist. The proposed
x dependence of the soft-mode behavior indicates that the ferroelectric phase
transition is of first order in BST with x?>?x?c, and of second order for low Ba
concentrations xc???x? ?0.1.

Hot workability characteristics of low-density Fe4Al1Ni ferritic steel. The hot-
working behavior of a low-density Fe4Al1Ni ferritic steel at the deformation
temperature in the range of and the strain rate in the range of 0.0110 s-1 was
studied on a Gleeble-3800 thermomechanical simulator by means of a compression
test. The hot-working behavior of the experimental steel was in accord with a
material with intermediate stacking fault energy. The deformation mechanism is
controlled by the glide and climb of dislocations. The constitutive equations
were established to predict peak stress. The apparent deformation activation
energy of experimental steel was about 347.5kJ/mol. Electron backscatter
diffraction was applied to study the microstructure after deformation. The
experimental results showed that both continuous dynamic recrystallization and
discontinuous dynamic recrystallization could occur, and increasing deformation
temperature and strain rate is conducive to the occurrence of discontinuous
dynamic recrystallization behavior. According the dynamic materials model, the
processing maps of the experimental steel were established. Combined with the
microstructure results, the power consumption efficiency of continuous dynamic
recrystallization, discontinuous dynamic recrystallization and dynamic recovery
decreases gradually. There are two flow instability domains, which are related
to mischcrystal microstructure caused by partial dynamic recrystallization. The
optimum deformation parameters for industrial processing are as follows:

On macroscopic and microscopic analyses for crack initiation and crack growth
toughness in ductile alloys. Relationships between crack initiation and crack
growth toughness are reviewed by examining the crack tip fields and microscopic
local and macroscopic continuum fracture criteria for the onset and continued
quasi-static extension of cracks in ductile materials. By comparison of the
micromechanisms of crack initiationvia transgranular cleavage and crack
initiation and subsequent growthvia microvoid coalescence, expressions are shown
for the fracture toughness of materials in terms of microstructural parameters,
including those deduced from fractographic measurements. In particular the
distinction between the deformation fields directly ahead of stationary and
nonstationary cracks are explored and used to explain why microstructure may
have a more significant role in influencing the toughness of slowly growing, as
opposed to initiating, cracks. Utilizing the exact asymptotic crack tip
deformation fields recently presented by Rice and his co-workers for the
nonstationary plane strain Mode I crack and evoking various microscopic failure
criteria for such stable crack growth, a relationship between the tearing
modulusT R and the nondimensionalized crack initiation fracture toughnessJ Ic is
described and shown to yield a good fit to experimental toughness data for a
wide range of steels.

Carbon nanotubes based multi-directional strain sensor. An investigation of the

both sensors are sensitive to strain. Relation between electrical anisotropy

the electromechanical behavior of an aligned CNT sensing patch strained at 45 in
order to validate its multi-directional sensing capability. Vertically aligned
CNT forests are produced by chemical vapor deposition CVD and then mechanically
knocked down onto polyimide PI films. Two configurations, diamond D sample and
square Sq sample, are considered. The relative electrical resistance R/R 0 and
the electrical anisotropy R B /R A upon strain increments are analyzed and
compared to previous work results 0 and 90 strain direction. Both 45 samples, D
and Sq, are sensitive to strain. A correlation between electrical anisotropy
behavior and strain direction 0, 45 and 90 is established. The results show that
with only an aligned CNT small patch it is possible to quantify and indicate
strain in three directions.

A simple method for computing the formation free energies of metal oxides. This
paper purposes a simple procedure for obtaining the formation free energy of
metal oxides in their solid states by introducing the concept of virtual solid
oxygen free energy. This scheme is meant to address the fact that standard
Density functional Theory DFT methods tend to exhibit poor accuracy for energy
differences between condensed and gas phases. The idea is to define an oxygen
reference state entirely in terms of solid oxide phases, so that formation free
energies can be obtained without having to compute molecular energies. The
proposed reference free energy can be easily obtained from both computations and
experiments, thus enabling the direct integration of DFT and experimental data.
Using the molybdenum system to construct this reference, we compute the
Ellingham diagram for oxides of Mo, Cu, Mg, Al and Zn, which all show good
agreement with experimental values. This procedure is independent of specific
total energy method used, and is applicable to formation free energy
calculations of any metal oxides.

extruded microstructure is quite uniform, which can be characterized as a
mixture of elongated and equiaxed subgrains with submicrometer size and high
misorientations. In static annealing, the as-extruded structure is quite stable
at and shows slow coarsening at. The microstructure resulted from more ECAE
passes higher strain is more readily to develop a uniform structure of equiaxed
grains in static annealing. Very high strength 394 MPa yield stress and 421 MPa
ultimate tensile strength and reasonable ductility 10.5% tensile elongation can
be obtained in this non-heat treatable aluminum alloy. The high strength can be
related to the structure of submicron-sized subgrains grains. To increase the
strain from 4 to 8 is beneficial for producing finer structure and higher
strength.

Identifying extreme ultraviolet lithography attenuated phase shifting mask
absorber materials using effective media approximation modeling. Pattern
transfer in an extreme ultraviolet lithography EUVL system requires reflective
optical elements illuminated at oblique illumination angles. This, in
combination with the three-dimensional effects at the mask, is the source of the
so-called mask 3D M3D effects that include shadowing, best focus shifts, and
contrast fading. Alternative mask absorbers at lower thickness possess the
ability to extenuate the M3D effects and improve overall imaging performance. An
approach to recognize candidate material combinations as alternative EUVL mask
absorbers through dielectric constant modeling by using methods involving Wiener
bounds and effective media approximation EMA is presented. Using EMA, several
stoichiometrically stable binary alloys of refractory metals that may serve as
attenuated phase shifting mask absorbers have been studied. The optical
properties and thickness of each absorber candidate alloy in a standard EUV mask
stack are optimized for imaging performance. The best performing alloys are
characterized through rigorous 3D image modeling of near-field intensity and
phase at varied illumination angles.

Microstructure and mechanical properties of MgZnCa alloy processed by equal
channel angular pressing. An ultrafine-grained UFG Mg5.12 wt.% Zn0.32 wt.% Ca
alloy with an average grain size of 0.7 m was produced by subjecting the as-
extruded alloy to equal channel angular pressing ECAP for 4 passes at. The fine
secondary phase restricted the dynamic recrystallized DRXed grain growth during
the ECAP processing, resulting in a remarkable grain refinement. A new texture
was formed in the ECAPed Mg alloy with the {0 0 0 2} plane inclined at an angle
of 58 relative to the extrusion direction. The yield stress YS was decreased in
the as-ECAPed alloy with finer grains, indicating that the texture softening
effect was dominant over the strengthening from grain refinement. The ductility
of the as-ECAPed alloy was increased to 18.2%. The grain refinement caused an
obvious decrease in work hardening rate in the as-ECAPed alloy during tensile
deformation at room temperature.

Tertiarybutylhydrazine: a new precursor for the MOVPE of Group III-nitrides.
Tertiarybutylhydrazine tBuHy, generated from tBuHy hydrocloride, was found to
have a convenient vapor pressure 6.7 mbar at for MOVPE applications. Thermolysis
of tBuHy, studied by quadrupole mass spectroscopy QMS, starts at about by
homolytic cleavage into reactive tBuNH and NH2 radicals. Almost complete
decomposition under QMS conditions is observed above. Mirror-like GaN epilayers
with mixed cubic:hexagonal and hexagonal structure were grown on GaAs and Al2O3
substrates, respectively, at using tBuHy and Me3Ga or Et3Ga with a V:III ratio
of 70. Low carbon incorporation was found in tBuHy-grown layers with respect to
layers grown with Me2Hy under the same conditions. 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

Thermodynamic properties of some solid nickel-indium alloys. The vapor pressure
of indium over five solid, binary nickel-indium alloys was measured by the
method of atomic absorption spectroscopy. The alloys exist in , , , , and +
phases of the nickel-indium system in the temperature range of this study. The
thermodynamic activity, partial molar enthalpy and partial molar entropy of
indium were calculated from the vapor pressure and the temperature coefficients.
The results are compared with previous work on and phases of the nickel-indium
system. It is found that the criterion of equality of chemical potential for
coexisting phases is obeyed and thus the accuracy of activity measurements in
these phases is confirmed.

Microstructure and mechanical properties of aluminium alloy 7A52 thick plates
welded by robotic double-sided coaxial GTAW process. The high strength aluminium
alloy 7A52 thick plate is commonly welded by double-V butt welding. The general
one sided arc welding requires indispensable root cleaning before the rear side
root weld, which consumes excessive time and cost. Thus the robotic welding is
always difficult to be carried on. In this paper, a novel robotic double-sided
coaxial GTAW process has been applied to the welding of Al7A52. The
microstructure and mechanical properties of the thick weld joints both welded by
robotic self-fluxing double sided coaxial GTAW RSF-DSC-GTAW and robotic wire-
feed double sided coaxial GTAW RWF-DSC-GTAW has been investigated. It was found
that the microstructures of weld zones of both processes typically consist of Al
and MgZn2 phases. Moreover, the weld zone of the RWF-DSC-GTAW joint exhibits
Interval layers distribution because of the less proportion of phase. The
average micro hardness in the weld zone of RSF-DSC-GTAW joints and RWF-DSC-GTAW
joints are 91.9HV and 80.1HV, respectively. With a better elongation property,
the average ultimate tensile strength of RSF-DSC-GTAW joint is 344Mpa. While it
is 244Mpa for the RWF-DSC-GTAW joint. It is considered that the mechanical
properties of the RSF-DSC-GTAW joint are more superior to the RWF-DS-GTAW joint.

deposited Al2O3 films on nanotextured fluorescent 6HSiC passivation is
investigated. The passivation effect on the light emission has been
characterized by photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence at room
temperature. The results show that 20nm thickness of Al2O3 layer is favorable to
observe a large photoluminescence enhancement 25.9% and long carrier lifetime
0.86ms. This is a strong indication for an interface hydrogenation that takes
place during post-thermal annealing. These result show that an Al2O3 layer could

Research on production, performance and fibre dispersion of PVA engineering
cementitious composites. Polyvinyl alcohol PVA fibre is considered as one of the
most suitable polymeric fibres to be used as the reinforcement of engineered
cementitious composites Research and application have shown that PVAECC can
significantly counteract the deficiency of ordinary concrete. In the present
paper, micromechanics based design theory and fracture mechanics formulation
leading to energy and strength criteria to achieve strain hardening and multiple
cracking are described. Engineered cementitious composites showing pseudo strain
hardening behaviour with over 6% of strain capacity under tension is produced.
Uniaxial tensile tests of PVAECC are conducted and the results support the
validity of the proposed theory. Also viscosity modifying agent plays an
important role in the dispersion of the fibres in the matrix. It is shown that a

A review of microstructure phenomena during manufacture of polycrystalline Ni-
based superalloys. The effects of manufacturing conditions on the microstructure
evolution of Ni-based superalloys are poorly understood, and the interchangeable
terminology to describe some microstructure phenomena is inconsistent. This
critical review aimed to address these issues through the discussion of seven
microstructure phenomena that occur during thermomechanical processing of
safety-critical components used in jet engines. Each phenomenon is outlined with
reference to grain nucleation and growth mechanisms, as well as processing
conditions under which they are observed. The processing conditions where each
phenomenon dominates are visualised through a series of contour plots. Through
this graphical representation, gaps of understanding in microstructure evolution
were identified and accompanied by recommendations for areas of further study.

using ITO nanoparticle inks. The electrical and optical properties of the ITO
films were investigated in order to understand the effects of annealing
temperatures under microwave. The decrease in the sheet resistance and
resistivity of the inkjet-printed ITO films was observed as the annealing
temperature increases. The film annealed at showed the sheet resistance of
517/sq with the film thickness of 580nm. The optical transmittance of the films
remained constant regardless of their annealing temperatures. In order to
further reduce the sheet resistance of the films, Ag-grid was printed in between
two layers of inkjet-printed ITO. With 3mm Ag-grid line-to-line pitch, the Ag-
grid inserted ITO film has the sheet resistance of 3.4/sq and the transmittance
of 84% after annealing at under microwave.

Powder processing and tensile properties of SiC whisker reinforced Al
composites.. SiC whisker reinforced aluminum composites with whisker volume
fraction ranging from 0 to 20% were fabricated by a powder metallurgy method,
that is, a combination of hot pressing and hot extrusion. The relation between
the microstructure and the tensile properties of the composites was
discussed.The main results obtained were as follows;1 The SiC/Al composites
fabricated by the appropriate combination of hot pressing and hot extrusion had
theoretical density. The deviation of whiskers from the extruded direction was
within about 4 degree.2 The tensile strength of SiC/Al composites increased with
increasing the volume fraction of SiC whisker; for example, 20 v% SiC/Al
composite had the tensile strength of 387MPa. The experimental tensile strength
exceeded the predicted one. The possible reason was that the real value of shear
yield stress of the matrix was larger than our estimate.3 The tensile fracture
behavior of SiC/Al composites was as follows. At first the interfacial voids
were formed at whiskers ends, then grew gradually and finally joined each other
along the shear direction.4 The tensile strength of SiC/Al composites at
elevated temperatures decreased with increasing temperature, but the tensile
strength of 20 v% SiC/Al composite at was two times as strong as that of pure
aluminum.

Suppressed ferroelectric relaxor behavior of Mn-modified BaZr0.3Ti0.7O3 relaxor
ceramics. MnCO3-modified BaZr0.3Ti0.7O3 relaxor ferroelectric ceramics were
fabricated by using the solid-state reaction method. The temperature dependences
of electrical and dielectric properties of the ceramics were systematically
investigated over the range 140 to. The typical ferroelectric relaxor behavior
of the BaZr0.3Ti0.7O3 ceramics was greatly suppressed by adding a proper amount
of MnCO3. The suppressed relaxor behavior can be restored by annealing the
samples in air, which is attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies in the
samples. In the paraelectric phase region, the low-frequency dielectric
relaxations associated with oxygen vacancies are observed above room
temperature, and increase with increasing of Mn content. Compared to the undoped
BaZr0.3Ti0.7O3 ceramic, Mn-doped samples display excellent temperature stability
in a wide temperature. The critical composition of x=0.05 MnCO3 not only
exhibits a lower degree of ferroelectric relaxor behavior Tm=5.6K, but also
maintains a relatively higher tunability 66.9%@30kVcm1 than that of pure

Discrete dislocation dynamics study on interaction between prismatic dislocation
loop and interfacial network dislocations.a series study of the discrete
dislocation dynamics DDD simulation on the interfacial dislocation network in
Ni-based superalloys, we have performed various DDD simulations on the stability
of dislocation network and its interaction with a prismatic dislocation loop.
Dislocations cannot keep its network shape if the line and Burgers vectors are
set to the experimental observation, while we can actually obtain stable
networks with the vectors and slip plane reported in molecular dynamics MD
simulations. Then we bump a prismatic dislocation loop into the networks,
showing that a mesh knot is replaced by the prismatic loop as reported in our
previous MD simulation. The interaction can be explained by the junction
formation between the network and prismatic loop, so that we can conclude that
any special modeling is not necessary for this interaction between the network
and prismatic loop.

Asymmetry evolutions in microstructure and strain hardening behavior between
tension and compression for AZ31 magnesium alloy. This work investigated the
asymmetry evolutions in the microstructure and the plastic deformation behavior
between the entire tension and compression for AZ31 magnesium alloy by combining
the experiment and visco-plastic self-consistent VPSC model. Large yield stress
asymmetry between the tension and the compression existed at the onset of
plastic deformation, but such stress asymmetry slightly increased first and then
gradually decreased to 1.01 with the increase of logarithmic plastic strain.
This kind of asymmetry variation was ascribed to the microstructure evolution
asymmetry. Compared to the tension deformation, tension twin boundaries migrated
more easily in the compression deformation owing to the appropriate crystal
orientation, producing more obvious fraction variation of tension twin boundary
and the intersection of different tension twin variants. The VPSC model
clarified the texture evolution asymmetry between the tension and the
compression by the contribution of each deformation mechanism to the macroscopic
strain, revealing that prismatic slip activation in the tension triggered the
development of 10 1 0 / / L D LD: loading direction type texture while abundant
tension twinning in the compression laid the foundation of 0002 / / L D type
texture. Additionally, owing to the deformation mechanism transformation from
basal slip to prismatic slip in tension deformation, the attenuation degree in
the strain hardening rate was gradually weakened, while in compression
deformation, the participation of elastic deformation contributed to the
increasing stage of strain hardening rate after the exhaustion of tension
twinning. In addition, the geometrical orientation factor and deformation
mechanism factor together contributed to the decline of flow stress asymmetry.

targeted drug delivery were synthesized by incorporation of polyvinyl alcohol
PVA, kappa -carrageenan Cara, and magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The magnetic
nanoparticles were obtained in situ in the presence of a mixture of polyvinyl
alcohol/ kappa -carrageenan CaraPVA. The produced magnetite-polymers were cross-
linked with freezingthawing technique and subsequent with K + solution. The
synthesized hydrogels were thoroughly characterized by transmittance electron
microscopy TEM, scanning electron microscopy SEM, X-ray diffraction XRD, thermal
gravimetric analysis TGA, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FT-IR, and
vibrating sample magnetometer VSM techniques. The dynamic swelling kinetic
models of hydrogels were analyzed according to the first- and second-order
kinetic models and were found that the experimental kinetics data followed the
second-order model well. Drug loading and release efficiency were evaluated by
diclofenac sodium DS as the model drug. The in vitro drug release studies from
hydrogels exhibited significant behaviors on the subject of physiological
simulated pHs and external magnetic fields. Investigation on the antibacterial
activity revealed the ability of drug-loaded hydrogels to inactivate the Gram-
positive Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus bacteria. The mucoadhesive properties

Local Electrical Properties of the 4HSiC0001/Graphene Interface. Local current
transport across graphene/4HSiC was studied with nanometric scale lateral
resolution by Scanning Current Spectroscopy on both graphene grown epitaxially
on 4HSiC0001 EG-SiC and graphene exfoliated from highly oriented pyrolitic
graphite and deposited on 4HSiC0001 DG-SiC. The study revealed that the Schottky
barrier height SBH of EG/4HSiC0001 is lowered by ~0.49eV. This is explained in
terms of Fermi-level pinning above the Dirac point in EG due to the presence of
positively charged states at the interface between Si face of 4HSiC and carbon-
rich buffer layer. Furthermore, Scanning Capacitance Spectroscopy based method
allowed evaluating local electron mean free path lgr in graphene. lgr in EG-SiC
was observed to be, on average, ~0.4 times that in DG-SiC and exhibited large
point-to-point variations due to presence of laterally homogeneous positively
charged buffer layer at the interface. However, lgr in graphene on SiC was
observed to be larger than on standard SiO2 samples DG-SiO2, which is explained
by better dielectric screening of charged impurities and lower surface polar
phonon scattering at the graphene/substrate interface.

Electrochemical Polarization and Passivation of Tin in neutral solutions of
chloride, bromide and iodide ions. Passivation of commercial grade tin 99.5% was
studied in 0.1 M KCl, KBr and KI solutions using the potentiodynamic technique
involving cathodic and anodic polarization at various scan rates. While low scan
rates 0.1 mV/sec lead to the complete deterioration of the anode in chloride
solutions, higher scan rates of 1 and 5 mV/sec lead to the appearance of two
anodic peaks. These peaks disappear at still higher rates 10 mV/sec. In bromide
solutions, two anodic peaks appear with scan rates of 1 and 5 mV/sec, and only
one peak is observed with 50 mV/sec. A white precipitate is formed in both
chloride and bromide solutions during anodic scanning. No gas evolution O2, Cl2
or Br2 could be detected up to anode potentials of 34 VSCE. At scan rates of 1
mV/sec and higher values, pitting does not occur, and thick anode films are
formed. The film is gray in chloride solutions, and yellowish gray in bromide
solutions. Values of the corrosion potential Ecor are recorded for the forward
and reverse scanning. The corrosion cd Icor is calculated both by the Tafel
extrapolation procedure and by the linear polarization technique. The latter
gives more accurate results. InCl and Br solutions, the first anodic peak
associated with passivation is more anodic than the equilibrium potentials for
the tin/tin oxides or hydroxides. Passivation is explained as a result of the
formation of the sparingly soluble salts SnOHCl, SnOHBr which appear both in the
precipitate and in the anode film. The passivating films are constituted at
least partially of these basic salts, and contain a proportion of the oxides and
hydroxides of Sn. From the effect of scan rates on the characteristics of the
anodic peaks, it appears that the formation of thick anode films is governed by
the diffusion kinetics for porous films. Of the three possibilities considered
as explanations for the second anodic peak oxidation of impurities, oxidation of
halides to oxyacids, and structural changes in the film the latter appears to be
the most probable one. Thick anodic films are not formed in iodide solutions
scan rates 1, 5, 10 mV/sec, and the anode surface remains very bright. Dense
evolution of I2 occurs during anodic polarization, and apart from I2 which
dissolves in solution, the latter remains clear. Only one peak is observed in
the forward anodic scanning. The polarization resistance technique gives Icor =
0. Thermodynamic calculations show that I3, HIO, IO, HIO3, IO3, HIO4, and IO4
occur in 0.1 M KI solutions at potentials less anodic than the potential of the
anodic peak 1.32 to 1.37 V, vs SCE. This peak potential is more anodic than the
quilibrium potential for I2 evolution.

Noble metals Pt, Au, and Ag as nucleating agents in BaO/SrO/ZnO/SiO2 glasses:
formation of alloys and coreshell structures. Noble metals such as Ag can be
used as nucleation agents in glass ceramics. In glasses, it is incorporated
predominantly as AgI . At temperatures slightly above the glass transition
temperature, T g , AgI reacts with SbIII to SbV and metallic Ag. Usually, face-
centered cubic Ag particles are nearly spherical and get facetted during crystal
growth. By contrast, in the case of BaO/SrO/ZnO/SiO2 glasses, silver has, in
comparison to other noble metals, another significant, yet different effect. It
forms metallic particles hexagonal phase with plate-like morphology during
thermal treatment at. In the second step of thermal treatment at, this phase
most probably expels some metallic Sb, which is oxidized by SbV present in the
surrounding glass phase to SbIII .a result, the plate-like morphology is
maintained and a crystalline shell around the metallic core is formed, mainly
consisting of ZnO with some SiO2 and antimony oxide, as proved by scanning
transmission electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy. This shell triggers the volume crystallization of
Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn2Si2O7 , a phase with low thermal expansion. By comparison, alloying
of Au with Sb does not occur according to the phase diagram. Instead, a thermal
treatment at temperatures slightly above T g leads to nanocrystalline, spherical
Au particles. Hence, alloying and subsequent decomposition of the alloy is a
prerequisite for the formation of plate-like noble metal particles.

Oxynitride glassesAn overview. The theory and practice of oxynitride glass
synthesis and property evaluation came into effect since late 70s. Its
importance lies in the fact of its formation at the grain-boundary of
synthesized silicon-nitride ceramics with additives. Earlier, heating an oxide
glass with NH3 and/or N2 was the route to obtain oxynitride glass. Later on
greater amount of nitrogen retention was made possible using AlN or Si3N4 as
batch material. Silicate, borate and phosphate systems were studied in isolation
or in conjugation. Melting temperature of such glasses varied from. Different
technological developments regarding furnace atmosphere, temperature,
compositions etc have been discussed towards a successful synthesis with a
thermodynamic approach. Nitrogen content in glass as high as 36.8 eq% has been
reported by the application of an overpressure of 30 atm N2. Different physical
and chemical properties have been discussed in relation to nitrogen content in
glass. Structural aspects have been considered with respect to XPS and IR
spectroscopic studies. Finally some points have been highlighted towards some
potential applications

Hydrogen-induced high damping of bulk metallic glasses. There are two important
topics concerned with the recent researches on the damping materials of
hydrogenated metallic glasses One is the mechanism of the high hydrogen-induced
internal friction of The other is the materials processing of bulkfor
engineering. This article describes the summary of our recent studies on these
topics. The first one is closely related to the local structure of the metallic
glasses. Therefore, our recent results on the intermediate-range local structure
of the simple two Zr-based metallic glasses are described, which has been
clarified by the Voronoi analysis using the experimental data of the neutron
diffraction measurements. The hydrogen-induced internal friction ofis also
discussed on the basis of these recent results of the local structure of the
metallic glasses. In terms of the second topic, the first successful preparation
of heavily hydrogenated Zr-based bulk HMG rods without hydrogen-induced surface
embrittlement is described. They are prepared by a powder-compact-melting and
liquid-casting process using ZrAlNiCu metallic glass and ZrH2 powders as the
starting materials. It has been found that they have high damping properties.

CRACK INITIATION BEHAVIOR OF ABS RESIN UNDER MODE I AND MIXED MODE LOADING. Mode
I and mixed mode loading testing of ABS resin were carried out by using compact
tension shear specimens. Two types of ABS resin were examined. The first one
ABS-1 has a butadiene rubber content of 18wt% in the form of small particles of
diameter of about 200nm. The second one ABS-2 has the same overall butadiene
rubber content but a bimodal particle distribution with diameters of 200nm and
500nm. Crack initiation behavior was observed by using a video microscope. The
fracture toughness of ABS-2 obtained by mode I testing is larger than that of
ABS-1. The fracture angle for both materials under mixed mode loading coincides
with the values predicted by the maximum hoop stress criterion. On the contrary,
at crack initiation under mixed mode loading, the critical values of KI and KII
are larger than those estimated by the maximum hoop stress criterion. The
increase in the critical values of KI and KII under mixed mode loading for ABS-2
is higher than those for ABS-1. The bimodal type distribution of rubber particle
size produces better fracture resistance.

Variant selection of precipitation in a beta titanium alloy during selective
laser melting and its influence on mechanical properties. A titanium alloy was
fabricated horizontally and vertically at two different energy densities by
selective laser melting. The microstructures of the as-fabricated samples were
examined using a range of characterization techniques and the properties
evaluated by tensile testing. It was found that the samples that were
horizontally built at the lower energy density were dominated by both and
athermal phases while the vertically built samples consist of not only and but
also nano-sized laths. Increased energy density led to a significant increase of
in horizontally built samples which tended to constitute a grid-like structure
in the matrix. All the -bearing samples showed preferential variant selection
and pronounced micro-texture. The -free samples all showed high 0.2% yield
strengths 922-934MPa, high ultimate tensile strengths 935-939MPa and good
ductility 10.2%13.8% elongation whereas the -bearing samples all exhibited poor

Processing of continuously reinforced Ti-alloy metal matrix composites MMC by
magnetron sputtering. The present work deals with a novel vapor synthesis route,
the matrix-coated fiber process, for producing SiC fiber reinforced Ti6Al4V and
Ti3AlNb orthorhombic titanium aluminide composites. In this process, the matrix
alloys were directly deposited on SiC fibers by magnetron sputtering. The matrix
deposition was conducted both as a batch process, wherein short-length fibers
were coated with the matrix material using a planar magnetron sputtering system,
as well as a continuous process, in which the matrix was deposited on continuous
SiC fibers using a reel-to-reel hollow-cathode magnetron sputtering system. The
matrix-coated fibers were consolidated to produce unidirectionally reinforced
composite panels. Unreinforced matrix alloy samples were also fabricated using
the same sputtering and consolidation conditions. Following heat treatments, the
microstructural evolution in these materials were studied. Tensile tests at room
temperature were also conducted on matrix and composite specimens. The results
indicated that PVD foils and fiber coatings can be heat-treated to obtain
microstructures similar to those obtained via conventional processing
approaches. Further, the room-temperature tensile properties of PVD foils are
comparable to conventionally rolled foils or sheets.

Macromodel of interfacial transition layer in ceramic matrix composites. The
purpose of the study is to create a macromodel of interfacial transition layer
in ceramic matrix composites. Chemical and mineralogical compositions were
investigated by means of X-ray fluorescence analysis and X-ray diffractometry,
ceramic and technological properties of raw materials were defined using
standard test methods for argillaceous raw materials. Phase composition and
structure of ceramic specimens were studied using a complex of modern physico-
chemical analysis methods. The layer-by-layer model of shell-core transition in
ceramic matrix material was suggested. Boundary conditions for obtaining
specimens were defined in terms of number of layers, thickness of such layers
and pitch of core-to-shell material ratio. Forced air supply was organized while
burning for directed heat and mass transfer inside the specimens. Mineral
composition of layers was defined for ceramic specimens with the core of iron
ore waste and the shell of clay. The study enabled to determine dependences
between qualitative and semi-quantitative variation of new mineral formations
content in transitional layers of a composite, which is the evidence of
interaction between the core and the shell products while burning a ceramic
matrix material.

Nanomaterials for photovoltaic conversion. A promising route for photovoltaic
conversion has emerged from the combination of electroactive nanomaterials and
small bandgap polymers. The formation of bulk heterojunctions resulting from the
extended interfaces leads to efficient dissociation of the charge pairs
generated under sunlight shown by the rapid extinction of the polymer
photoluminescence for increasing contents of fullerenes or TiO2 nanoparticles in
MEH-PPV or PVK. Unconventional elaboration routes of the blends have been
developed to increase the nanofiller dispersion and inhibit phase separation at
high concentration. The size reduction of the acceptor domains led to a complete
quenching of the radiative recombinations, obtained by specific solvent
processing of MEH-PPV / C60 nanocomposites or sol gel elaboration of TiO2
nanoparticles in a PVK film. A simultaneous increase of the photocurrents could
be achieved by the dispersion and size optimisation of the nanofillers. In situ
generation of silver particles in MEH-PPV provides an example of enhanced charge
separation induced by the plasmon resonance at the metal/polymer interface. The
strong influence of the molecular morphology on the nanocomposite properties
emphasizes the large improvements which can still be gained on the performances
of organic solar cells.

Low Stress Tetrahedral Amorphous Carbon Films Prepared by Filtered Vacuum Arc
Deposition. The tetrahedral amorphous carbon films are attracting materials
because of their properties similar to diamond, such as high hardness,
resistivity, optical transparency, chemical inertness and low coefficient of
friction. These properties make it ideal for wear resistance application on
cutting tools, automotive component, aerospace components and orthopedic
prosthesis etc. In this paper the structures, mechanical properties and wear
resistance of the tetrahedral amorphous carbon films deposited on silicon under
lower pulse bias voltage by filtered catholic vacuum arc deposition system have
been investigated. The high quality tetrahedral amorphous carbon film has been
obtained. The hardness and elastic modulus of the low stress tetrahedral
amorphous carbon films are higher than 60Gpa and 380Gpa respectively determined
by nano indentation tests. The friction performance of the tetrahedral amorphous
carbon films was also studied by SRV tests, the results show: the tetrahedral
amorphous carbon films have much lower wear rate than that of silicon substrate.

Step-scheme CdS/TiO2 nanocomposite hollow microsphere with enhanced
photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. Converting solar energy into chemical
energy by artificial photosynthesis is promising in addressing the issues of the
greenhouse effect and fossil fuel crisis. Herein, a novel photocatalyst,e.
CdS/TiO2 hollow microspheres HS, were dedicatedly designed to boost overall
photocatalytic efficiency. TiO2 nanoparticles were in-situ decorated on the
inside and outside the shell of CdSHS, ensuring close contact between TiO2 and
CdS. The CdS/TiO2HS with abundant mesopores inside of the shell boost the light
absorption via multiscattering effect as well as accessible to reactions in all
directions. The heterojunction was scrutinized and the charge transfer across it
was revealed by in-situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ISI-XPS.
Ultimately, the charge transfer in this composite was determined to follow step-
scheme mechanism, which not only facilitates the separation of charge carriers
but also preserves strong redox ability. Benefited from the intimate linkage
between CdS and TiO2 and the favorable step-scheme heterojunction, enhanced
photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity was accomplished. The CH4 yield rate of
CdS/TiO2 reaches 27.85 mol g1 h1, which is 145.6 and 3.8 times higher than those
of pristine CdS and TiO2, respectively. This work presents a novel insight into
constructing step-scheme photocatalytic system with desirable performance.

Static and fatigue behaviour of room temperature vulcanising silicone adhesives
for high temperature aerospace applications. Statisches Verhalten und
Dauerfestigkeitsanalyse von vulkanisierten Silikonklebstoffen fr
Luftfahrtanwendungen bei hohen Temperat. This paper focuses on the mechanical
properties of room temperature vulcanising RTV silicone adhesives for aerospace
applications. In view of the very limited amount of published data on this
subject, we analyzed the performances of two RTV silicone rubber adhesives
through adhesive joint tests. The standard Thick Adherend Shear Test TAST was
performed in order to measure the shear properties of the adhesives. Single lap
jointswere fabricated and tested to assess the adhesive performance in a joint.
The influence of temperature on the lap-shear strength of the adhesives was
investigated. It is shown that the lap-shear strength of both adhesives
decreased with increasing of temperature. The effect of bondline thickness and
overlap length on the lap-shear strength of the adhesives was also studied. The
reduction of failure load with an increase of the bondline thickness is a very
common situation when dealing with structural adhesives. However, for the tested
RTV silicone adhesives the failure loads increased as the bondline was made
thicker. Also, the failure loads of RTV silicone adhesive joints increased
almost proportionally with increasing the overlap length. Fatigue tests were
also performed and show a low dispersion of the results.

Competitive growth of diverging columnar grains during directional
solidification: A three-dimensional phase-field study. Competitive growth of
diverging columnar grains during directional solidification were investigated
through three-dimensional phase-field simulations. The elimination rate of the
unfavorably oriented grain increased with its inclination angle. The elimination
rate of the unfavorably oriented grain in three-dimensional diverging grain
growth was fastest in competitive growths dominated by branching mechanism. The
competitive growth of two diverging grains in the directional solidification
process was investigated through three-dimensional 3D phase-field simulations.
We explored the diverging grain boundary GB evolution and quantitatively
analyzed the grain elimination in cases with different inclined angles of UO
dendrites. It is found that the stochastic tertiary branching behavior resulted
in a zigzag diverging GB. Previous two dimensional 2D simulations about the
competitive growth of diverging grains indicate a non-monotonic variationthat
is, first increases and then decreasesof the grain elimination rate with the
inclined angle of UO dendrites. The grain elimination in 3D diverging cases,
however, shows a monotonic manner.the spatial arrangement of FO dendrites
relative to UO dendrites was a stagger configuration in 3D, not the face-to-face
configuration in 2D, the competition of secondary arms at the GB region was not
intense. Consequently, the liquid space size sandwiched by diverging grains
became the leading factor influencing the grain elimination, and the grain
elimination rate increased with the inclined angle of UO dendrites. Moreover,
without the intense competition of secondary arms during the 3D diverging grain
growth, the elimination of the UO grain was faster than those in 2D diverging
grain growth and 3D non-uniplanar grain growth. These conclusions clarify the
inconsistency between the previous 2D simulation research and the experimental
research regarding the grain elimination in diverging competitive growth.

Fatigue behavior of a Hi-Nicalon/SiCB4C composite at in air and in steam. Hi-
Nicalon/SiCB ceramic composite with a self-healing matrix exhibits good fatigue
performance at in air. The loading frequency has minimal effect on the fatigue
performance of Hi-Nicalon/SiCB at in air. At, the presence of steam has little
influence on the fatigue performance of the composite at 1.0 Hz, but noticeably
degrades fatigue lifetimes at 0.1 Hz. Fiber degradation during fatigue is not
caused by oxidation, but is due to an intrinsic creep-controlled flaw growth
mechanism. The fatigue performance of the Hi-N/SiCB composite is controlled by
the creep resistance of the Hi-Nicalon fibers. Effects of steam environment on
fatigue behavior of a non-oxide ceramic composite with a multilayered matrix
were investigated at. The composite was produced via chemical vapor infiltration
CVI. The composite had an oxidation inhibited matrix, which consisted of
alternating layers of silicon carbide and boron carbide and was reinforced with
laminated woven Hi-Nicalon fibers. Fiber preforms had pyrolytic carbon fiber
coating with boron carbon overlay applied. Tensile stressstrain behavior and
tensile properties were evaluated at. Tension-tension fatigue tests were
conducted at 0.1 Hz and at 1.0 Hz for fatigue stresses ranging from 100 to 140
MPa in air and in steam. Fatigue run-out was defined as 10 5 cycles at 0.1 Hz
and as 2 10 5 cycles at 1.0 Hz. Presence of steam had little influence on
fatigue performance at 1.0 Hz, but noticeably degraded the fatigue lifetimes at
0.1 Hz. Specimens that achieved run-out were subjected to tensile tests to
failure to characterize the retained tensile properties. Prior fatigue in air
and in steam caused significant reduction in tensile strength and modulus.
Composite microstructure, as well as damage and failure mechanisms were
investigated.

temperature ramps used for the carbonization.-SiC layers were deposited on 001

measured by makyoh, obtaining 2D maps of the entire wafers. For the same pre-
growth procedures, the substrate curvature depends strongly on the orientation
of the substrate, 001 or 111, being generally lower for 111 substrates. The
deformation results were compared with XRD and Raman spectroscopy. Plastic
deformation of the substrate was evidenced by XRD, while the presence of tensile

Mechanism for the multi-stage precipitation of FeNi based alloy. This work lays
great emphasis on the distribution evolution of sigma phase in FeNi based N08028
alloy during aging process, the result of which could provide new insights into
phase change and precipitation mechanism. It is found that the phase, in any
case, tends to separate out with a granular shape at grain boundariesprimarily,
and with the increment of time, it is obliged to precipitate in grain
interiorswith a lamellar structure. The mechanisms for the evolving volume
fraction and morphology of phase are discussed, and a model appropriate for the
multi-stage behavior transforming from intergranular to intragranular
precipitation is derived, as well as revealing the thermodynamics and
transformation kinetics corresponding to this process. The results reveal that
the occurrence of multi-stage precipitation is correlated with the
redistribution of solute atoms and with the difference in coupling effect of
thermodynamic driving force and kinetic activation energy between the
intergranular and intragranular precipitation.

Simple macro/microcoupling mathematical model and its predicting on effects of

developed in this paper and its predicted results, the effects of processing
factors such as pouring temperature, casting velocity and molten pool height on
the solidification structure forr18Ni9Ti stainless steel thin strip with ideal
solidification type are investigated. In the developed model, the latent heat is
treated by enthalpy method; the grid and nodes are divided by the assumed
streamlines. Moreover, the heterogeneous nucleation and columnar-to-equiaxed
transition CET models are also introduced, together with the revising of
dendrite growth dynamic model of KurzGiovanolaTrivedi KGT. With the help of
solid fraction, the coupling of macro/micromodels is realised using different

Electron backscatter diffraction characterisation of liquid route processed
Ti6242S/SCS-6 composites. Liquid route processed filamentary titanium matrix
composites reinforced by ceramic filaments were investigated using electron
backscatter diffraction and high resolution scanning electron microscopy. As-
processed filamentary materials possess a metastable microstructure with
martensitic +retained matrix and small sub-stoichiometric TiC1 x precipitates at
the fibre/matrix interface. The heat treatment induced morphological and
crystallographic modification of carbides and coarsening of the matrix. The
analysis method was also used to validate a simulation route to obtain bulk
materials having similar microstructural properties.

Electro-thermalmechanical performance of a sensor based on PAN carbon fibers and
real-time detection of change under thermal and mechanical stimuli. Structural
health monitoring SHM is a vastly growing field consisting of sensors embedded
in or attached with the structure which respond to the strain or other stimuli
to monitor the deformation in real-time. In this study, a carbon fiber CF sensor
was developed using unidirectional Polyacrylonitrile PAN carbon filaments
aligned straightly together and its sensitivity was calculated experimentally,
with the gauge factor GF in 10.2-10.8 range. The electro-thermal behavior of
this CF sensor showed distinct performance and detected the change in the
surrounding temperature. There is a good reproducibility in the results in both
piezoresistive and electrothermal behavior of the CF sensor and its electrical
performance showed real-time detection of both mechanical and thermal stimuli.
The results established that the CF exhibited good potential as a flexible
strain sensor for in-situ monitoring of damage or energy release during the
failure of composites.

Synthesis and Evaluation of Ceramic Materials. Microstructures and Mechanical
Properties of BiSrCaCuO/AgSuperconductor Composites.. The effects of Ag addition
on the mechanical and superconducting properties of Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox BSCCO
superconductors were studied, and their microstructures were observed mainly by
transmission electron microscopy TEM. The addition of 10 wt% Ag resulted in an
increase in average bending strength from 126 to 170MPa, in Weibul modulus from
3.8 to 9.8 and in the hardness normal to the c plane from 38.7 to 51.8kgf/mm2.
The critical current density Jc of BSCCO bulk was also increased by addition of
Ag. Ag existed as fine particles with the size of about 1m inside BSCCO grains,
and as the second phase at grain boundaries. The Ag phase was strengthened by
coherent fine particles of Cu. At the interface between Ag and BSCCO, a BiO
single layer existed. The mechanical properties of Ag/BSCOO composites were
discussed from the view point of the microstructures.

Rapid microwave-assisted synthesis of silver decorated-reduced graphene oxide
nanoparticles with enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light. A
facile, fast, and scalable microwave irradiation MWI method for the synthesis of
Ag nanoparticles Agdispersed on graphene sheets has been developed. The
reduction of graphene oxide takes place in ethanol solution within 2min of MWI
without any additional reducing agent or complicated treatment. The morphology
and microstructure of the as-prepared hybrid were characterized by Scanning
electron microscopy SEM and Transmission electron microscopy TEM images. The
result showed the Agwith an average size of 510nm decorated on the rGO sheets.
X-ray powder diffraction XRD determined that the crystallographic structure of
Ag is face-centered cubic and there was a strong interaction between Agand rGO
sheets. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy XPS showed that GO had been reduced to rGO in our hybrid. Moreover,
visible photocatalytic activity of the rGOAg nanocomposites was tested using
Rhodamine BRhB as the model contaminant. This result indicates that rGOAg
nanocomposites display distinctly enhanced photocatalytic activities. The
investigation gave a promise to the development of original yet highly efficient
graphene-based photocatalysts that utilize visible light as an energy source.

Influence of Pore-enlarging with Ultrasonic Wave on Microstructures of AAO
Template. Anodic aluminum oxide films can be prepared by anodizing highly pure
aluminum foils in 0.3mol/dm~3 H_2C_2O_4 solution by a two-step preparation
technology.The microstructures of Al_2O_3 can be controlled by different pore-
enlarging methods.Images of SEM and FE-SEM indicate that anodic alumina oxide
template enlarged with ultrasonic wave for 20min has nearly ideal nanopore
arrays,the diameter of pore is enlarged from 30nm to 70nm.Distinctly the effect
with ultrasonic wave is better than ordinary method.When Al_2O_3 films were kept
vibrating for 40min,the diameter of pore was enlarged to 100nm,but some regions
of the films were destroyed.When anodic voltages arised,the pore diameter was
enlarged and the template showed better nanopore arrays.

Effects of plasma parameters on increasing the purity of nitrogen atom
encapsulated fullerene in an RF plasma. Relatively high purity of nitrogen atom
encapsulated fullerene N@C 60 has been synthesized by an electron beam
superimposed radio frequency RF discharge plasma method. Nitrogen species are
characterized by an optical emission spectroscopy OES; and a relationship
between optical emission spectra and the purity of N@C 60 has been examined. It
is observed that the increased amount of nitrogen molecule ions impinging on the
sublimated fullerenes enhance the synthesis of N@C 60 . Here, it is cleared that
the efficient synthesis of N@C 60 is possible by controlling the parameters of
electron beam superimposed RF plasma.a consequence, comparatively high purity of
about 0.08% of N@C 60 has been obtained.

The Effect of Heat Treatment on Mechanical and Corrosion Performances of
ZrNbAlloy. The mechanical performance and corrosion resistance of ZrNb alloy
Zr705 treated in different ways is tested, and it is found that those properties
of ZrNb alloy are significantly affected by heat treatment. The most important
parameter of the heat treatment is quenching temperature. The ZrNb alloy,
quenched below the critical quenching temperature Tcq a temperature or a range
of temperature between-870C presents good corrosion resistance performance,
however, quenched above the Tcq gets a higher strength and a lower corrosion
resistance. Through the study on the basis of the evidences gotten by means of
metallographic, SEM, EPMA and TEM, the conclusion can be drawn as that the
effect of heat treatment on the performances of ZrNb alloy is primarily because
of the mechanism of the distribution change of Nb, the quantity of -Zr, the
morphology of grains. Keywords: ZrNb alloy, heat treatment, -Zr, twins

Impact resistance of high-density polyethylene against falling penetrator with
different potential energy. This study deals with high-density polyethylene HDPE
which was subjected the drop-weight test. HDPE is a semicrystalline
thermoplastic polymer which is commonly used in many applications and mainly in
the automotive industry because of its properties. The injection moulded HDPE
samples were subjected the penetration test at different potential energies and
the results were subsequently evaluated and discussed. The samples were tested
in the range of potential energies from 30 to 230 J. The first sample
penetration occurred at the energy 50 J. It was found out that the potential
energy 30 J is too small for penetration of this material, which shows the
impact resistance of HDPE.

Influence of Process Parameters on Tensile Strength of the Friction Welded
AA6063-T6 Joints by BoxBehnken Design Approach. The present investigation
demonstrates the friction welding of the AA6063-T6 joint to attain the maximum
tensile strength by optimizing the parameters friction load, friction time, and
upset load through response surface methodology. BoxBehnken design is a subset
of the response surface methodology RSM which was employed to design the
experiment numbers, and it was restricted to 15 sets. Furthermore, the inbuilt
ANOVA technique was used to obtain the statistical data for the developed
numerical model, and the relationship among the parameters against the output
response tensile strength was interpreted by using the statistical data.
Following this, the mechanical and metallurgical studies were done on the
optimized conditions using appropriate testing and characterization equipment.
The optimized conditions such as friction load f of 3 kN along with friction
time t of 6 s and an upset load of 2.5 kN are given as input to attain the
highest TS of 248 MPa. Moreover, the interface between the weld zone and the
base metal of the joint was found to be broken during the tensile test when the
friction load was given as 3 kN and 4 kN, while the fracture location of the
joint was found in the weld zone at the lower friction load of 2 kN. Finally,
the acquired results of the optimized friction welded conditions on the
AA6063-T6 joint were discussed to justify the statistical data of the numerical
model, and the same results were compared to the previous research studies.

Shear-Dependent Yield Stress of Iron Ore Fine Tailings in Two-Step Flocculation
Process. Both shear and flocculation have a significant influence on the
rheological behavior of tailings, especially the yield stress. In the two-step
flocculation process, the above two kinds of actions exist at the same time, and
they influence each other. In order to explore the change rule of the yield
stress and its internal causes, a two-step flocculation process of the iron ore
fine tailings with different shear conditions in the four different phases was
designed. In the primary flocculation phase, tailing particles combined with the
primary flocculant and formed a primary floc network structure. In the primary
broken phase, shear destroyed the primary floc network structure and decreased
the average floc size, so the shear-dependent yield stress, the floc strength
factor, and the fractal dimension decreased. In the secondary flocculation
phase, broken floc combined with the secondary flocculant and produced a more
compact floc network structure which had a better shear resistance. Therefore,
in the secondary broken phase, with the increase of shear, the decrease of yield
stress, the floc strength factor, and fractal dimension were less obvious than
that in the primary broken phase. In both two broken phases, the yield stress of
the secondary flocculating slurry was always higher than that of the primary
flocculating slurry, but with the increase of shear, the difference became
smaller. The floc strength and fractal dimension also showed the same rule. The
internal reasons for the stronger shear resistance of the secondary flocculating
slurry were the increase of the number of binding sites, the electric
neutralization between the two flocculants, and the steric hindrance effect of
the flocculants.

Numerical Tracking of the Behavior of Repaired Reinforced Concrete Beams by CFRP
Sheets against Shear. This study simulates a procedure of rehabilitation of
reinforced concrete beams with the aid of ANSYS 17 software. In this work, the
BIRTH and DEATH procedure in ANSYS was adopted to model the post-repairing
stage. This aspect has rarely been considered by previous studies that utilized
a carbon fiber reinforced polymer CFRP sheet when retrofitting. To verify the
suggested technique, six specimens were analyzed with two values of shear span-
to-depth ratios 3 and 4 and three spaces of CFRP sheets 100mm, 150mm and 200mm.
The effect of the repairing process on the structural performance of the
retrofitted beam is also investigated.It is found that the suggested technique
yielded a good agreement with the experimental results and the maximum
differences in the failure loads between the numerical and experimental results
were 10% and 4% for shear span-to-depth ratios of 3 and 4, respectively. It was
also ascertained that upgrading reinforced concrete members within the early
stages of loading showed a better enhancement in the loading capacity compared
to upgrading reinforced concrete members close to the juncture of failure.

Effect of Fe and Zr additions on phase formation in -type TiMo alloys. The
effect of 1% Fe and/or 5% Zr mass% additions on phase formation was investigated
for the Ti15Mo alloy by means of X-ray diffraction analysis and hardness
testing. Upon water quenching following solution treatment in the phase region,
the athermal phase formation could not be observed in all the alloys, regardless
of Fe and Zr additions. The lattice parameter of the phase decreases with Fe
addition, while it increases with Zr addition. Solid solution strengthening by
Fe and Zr is not recognized for the phase. The isothermal phase formed after
aging at and for 3.6 ks, which results in a decrease in the lattice parameter of
the phase and an increase in the hardness. The isothermal phase formation is
suppressed with Fe and/or Zr additions. This is interpreted as the consequence
of the increase in the average value of the bond order Bo for the Ti15Mo5Zr and
Ti15Mo5Zr1Fe alloys, and of the decrease in the average value of the metal
d-orbital energy level Md for the Ti15Mo1Fe alloy. In addition, the degree of
the suppression of isothermal phase can be predicted by the average values of Bo
and Md.

particle morphology is an essential part of producing high quality latex
products.These factors fall into two broad categories: thermodynamics and
kinetics.The thermodynamic factors,which determine the equilibrium morphology of
the final polymer latex particle,are necessary conditions of latex particle
morphology development,while kinetic factors,which determine the ease with which
such thermodynamically favored morphology can be achieved,are sufficient
conditions for its development.The theory and model of polymer latex particle
morphology constructed considering the two kinds of factors can provide
instructions to the designation,simulation,building,regulation and control of

Changes of Magnetic Field and Microstructure in Type 304 Stainless Steel
Subjected to High-Temperature Damage. It has been found that magnetic property
changes in austenitic stainless steel subjected to creep at high temperature.
The change of magnetic property is mainly due to decrease the chromium
concentration in the vicinity of grain boundary and transform into martensite in
the area. But this result is for short-term creep. It is necessary to evaluate
the long-term creep in order to develop non-destructive technique for plants.
Moreover it is important to evaluate the fatigue. The change of magnetic
property for those damages at high temperatures is investigated. The
transformation into martensite is observed for both the long-term creep and
fatigue. The magnetic regions are observed in sever deformed area and near
crack. Then the formation of magnetic phases is related to the damage.

Strengthening mechanism for high-entropic weld of molybdenum/Kovar alloy
electron beam welded joint. High-entropic weld was acquired by adding high-
entropy alloy interlayer into molybdenum/Kovar alloy electron beam welded joint
to optimize the mechanical properties. The tensile strength of joint was up to
358 MPa when the high-entropy alloy interlayer was 1.0 mm thick, corresponding
to the increase of 87% compared to the only 191 MPa of the joint without high-
entropy alloy interlayer. The microstructure of the weld was transformed from
-Fe matrix with reticular -Fe into the combination of pro-eutectic fcc and
eutectic fcc + laves, as is expected from the increase in the volume of high-
entropy alloy into the weld. The brittle reaction interface along the fusion
line of molybdenum side was predominately changed after adding high-entropy
alloy interlayer. The original continuous FeMo at the edge of -Mo in reaction
interface, which was responsible for the inferior bearing capacity of the joint,
was gradually decreased and replaced by intermittent fine FeCr as the high-
entropy alloy interlayer was thicker. The optimization of tensile strength
derived from the transformation from continuous FeMo to intermittent FeCr. The
superior affinity of Cr to Fe and Mo compared to the affinity between Fe and Mo
itself was the underlying reason for the decrease and morphology change in
brittle . High-entropic weld was acquired by adding high-entropy alloy
interlayer. Tensile strength of Mo/Kovar joint was increased from 191 MPa to 358
MPa. Strengthening mechanism was studied from microstructure evolution. The
affinity among Cr, Fe and Mo was analyzed.

On the spiral growth of polytype structures in SiC from a faulted matrix I.
Polytypes based on the 6H structure. The different intrinsic and extrinsic fault
configurations that can occur in the close-packed 6H structure, ABCACB, are
considered and their stacking fault energies calculated to determine the
relative probability of their occurrence. Two-fault configurations are found to
be most probable. Polytype structures that can result by spiral growth around
single screw dislocations of different Burgers vector created in a 6H matrix
containing the most probable fault configurations have been deduced. It is shown
that polytype structures can result from screw dislocations of integral as well
as non-integral Burgers vectors and a much larger number of structure series are
actually possible than those deduced earlier from a perfect 6H matrix. A screw
dislocation step of a given number of layers can give rise to several different
polytype structures depending on the position of the fault in the exposed ledge.
Of these the most probable structures have been determined by calculating their
stacking fault energies. The most probable series of structures predicted
theoretically from such a faulted matrix model for the growth of polytypes are
compared with the structures observed so far. There is an excellent agreement
between the theoretically predicted and experimentally observed structures. The
model explains the observed limitations on the Zhdanov number of the SiC
polytypes and can be used in structure determination for predicting the most
probable structures for a new polytype.

Pressure-induced amorphization and polyamorphism: Inorganic and biochemical
systems. Pressure-induced amorphization PIA is a phenomenon that involves an
abrupt transition between a crystalline material and an amorphous solid through
application of pressure at temperatures well below the melting point or glass
transition range. Amorphous states can be produced by PIA for substances that do
not normally form glasses by thermal quenching. It was first reported for ice Ih
in 1984 following prediction of a metastable melting event associated with the
negative initial melting slope observed for that material. The unusual
phenomenon attracted intense interest and by the early 1990s PIA had been
reported to occur among a wide range of elements and compounds. However, with
the advent of powerful experimental techniques including high resolution
synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering combined with more precise control over
the pressurization environment, closer examination showed that some of the
effects previously reported as PIA were likely due to formation of nanocrystals,
or even that PIA was completely bypassed during examination of single crystals
or materials treated under more hydrostatic compression conditions. Now it is
important to understand these results together with related discussions of
polyamorphic behavior to gain better understanding and control over these
metastable transformations occurring in the low temperature range where
structural relaxation and equilibration processes are severely constrained. The
results will lead to useful new high-density amorphous materials or
nanocrystalline composites containing metastable crystalline varieties and the
experiments have driven new theoretical approaches to modeling the phenomena.
Here we review the incidence and current understanding of PIA along with related
phenomena of density- and entropy-driven liquidliquid phase transitions LLPT and
polyamorphism. We extend the discussion to include polymeric macromolecules and
biologically-related materials, where the phenomena can be correlated with
reversible vs irreversible unfolding and other metastable structural
transformations.

micromechanism of their destruction in exploitation is exclusively the ductile
one. In order to make an estimation of the level of the damage that occurs in
exploitation, in this paper a combined experimental and numerical procedure has
been developed based on micromechanical or local approach to the fracture
mechanics of metallic materials. After the analysis of the results obtained for
micromechanical criterion of failure for virgin steel and that used in the steam
pipeline, a proposal for prolongation of the working life of tested steel for
steam pipelines until the next overhaul is given.

Finite element study on rotary friction welding process for mild steel. The
purpose of study is to investigate friction welding of series of mild steel by
using Finite element analysis by a 3D model made in order having a proper
rotational speed and time friction. This Numerical analysis divided into two
categories that is structural analysis, and thermal analysis. Structural
analysis process parameters can also have divided 4 kinds that are frictional
time, frictional pressure, deformation and rotational speed. The thermal
analysis process parameters are dealing with and counted as heat flux, and
temperature. Friction welding with three different rotational speeds 2000 RPM,
2500 RPM, and 3000 RPM &amp; three different friction time 150 s, 200 s, and 250
s This study used SOLIDWORKS 2016 and ANSYS 17.2. SOLIDWORKS 2016 is the
software used for designing work pieces geometry while ANSYS 17 is the software
is used to analyzed finite element analysis on the work pieces. The second
purpose of study is the numerical analysis would be compared with the
experimental analysis. The experimental analysis is taken place at friction
welding machine in the laboratory of technology production of the University of
Riau. Based on the numerical analysis we can summarized that the faster the
shaft rotates would resulting the higher the temperature generated, the higher
the heat flux generated, &amp; the higher the reduced of length. Also the
influence of friction time shown that the longer the time of friction would
result the lower the temperature generated, the lower the heat flux generated,
the lower the reduced of length value. By compared the numerical and
experimental analysis we can conclude that the difference reduced of length data
between simulation and experimental happened because on simulation only input
the friction pressure, while on experiment friction and forging pressure
happened simultaneously. By interpolating the result with the melting point of
mild steel 1350 C we can gather the minimum requirement for getting a uniform
weld temperature for each friction time, that were; 2650 rpm for 150 s friction
time, 2852 rpm for 200 s friction time, &amp; 3034 rpm for 250 s friction time.

Substructure evolution and flow behaviour of AISI 316L stainless steel
polycrystals at room temperature. The flow stress of polycrystals is controlled
by the processes occurring in the grain interior as well as in the mantle,e. at
the grain boundary and its immediate vicinity. This study deals with the
substructure evolved and the resulting strength in these two regions at
different strains during room temperature deformation of AISI 316L stainless
steel with an average grain size of 4, 12 or 30 m. The strain range employed was
0.26%. Bright field transmission electron microscopy was employed to measure
dislocation densities. The density EGBD of extrinsic grain boundary dislocations
was measured in the grain boundary plane. The dislocation density V in the grain
boundary vicinity was measured within a region extending 1 m on either side of a
grain boundary. The dislocation density GI in the grain interior was measured in
the remaining area of the grain. Microhardness measurements were made using the
microhardness tester and the indentations were evaluated using an automatic
image analysis system and a specially developed software program to determine
the strength of the material in the two zones. The profiles i.e. the variation
from a grain boundary to the centre of a grain of dislocation densities and
hardness values at different strain levels have been analysed to assess the role
of the grain interior and the mantle zone in the overall deformation behaviour
of the polycrystal.

Characterization of Packaged 6.5 kV SiCPiN-Diodes up to. Silicon Carbide bipolar
diodes offer unique ultrafast switching behavior for high voltage and high power
applications 1. But due to the small chip size it is required to parallel a lot
of dice and therefore it is necessary to get detailed information about the
electrical and thermal behavior of single diodes. For the characterization in
the full current and voltage regime we have developed a molded leadframe
package. The package was designed with a lateral contact geometry and a high
creepage distance of 20 mm, which enable us to characterize these diodes for
high voltage applications. Forward and reverse IV characteristics and turn-off
behavior under hard switching conditions up to are reported. Additionally the
forward voltage stability and power cycling tests are discussed.

Use of Brazilian Clay in Nylon 6 with Different Molecular Weight Nanocomposites.
The effect of nylon 6 Ny6 molecular weight on the development of polymer/layered
silicates nanocomposites prepared by the melt intercalation technique was
studied in this work. The nylon6/organoclay nanocomposites were prepared in the
counter-rotational twin screw extruder. The results of torque rheometry showed
that the presence of organoclay in the nylon 6 increased the torque. The results
of X-ray diffraction XRD and transmission electron microscopy TEM showed
exfoliated and/or partially exfoliated structures.

Angular dependence of magnetic reversal in two-phased nanolayers. The reversal
process of hard/soft/hard multilayer systems as functions of easy axis and
thickness L s of the soft layer has been investigated within a micromagnetic
approach. The nucleation field could be obtained for =0 and =/2 which decreases
as L s increases. The coercivity, on the other hand, decrease smoothly with the
soft layer thickness disregarding to the value of . The coercivity becomes the
largest when =/2, while the corresponding nucleation field becomes negative for
larger L s . Thus the change of the magnetization proceeds slower for =/2,
giving rise to an oblique hysteresis loop. In addition, the critical thickness
for the soft layer is rather small, where the dominant coercivity mechanism
changes from nucleation to pinning, suggesting that pinning is the main
coercivity mechanism in the material. When is an angle between 0 and /2, a fully
saturated state can never be reached. Thus the pure nucleation becomes
meaningless and pinning is the dominant coercivity mechanism.

prepared respectively by melting mixing and sol mixing technology. Scanning
electron microscope SEM,differential scanning calorimetr DSC,electronic tensile

microstructure,crystallization behaviour,mechanical properties and bioactivity
of HA/PA66 composites.a results,the distribution uniformity of HA particles and
the interface combination strength of HA/PA66 composites prepared by sol mixing
are better than that of HA/PA66 composites prepared by melting mixing
technology,but due to the dissolution of PA66 and hydrogen-bonding between HA

composites are lower than that of HA/PA66 composites prepared by melting mixing
technology. Both HA/PA66 composites prepared by this two routes exhibit good

Cu nanoparticle-decorated two-dimensional carbon nanosheets with superior
photothermal conversion efficiency of 65 % for highly efficient disinfection
under near-infrared light. Strong NIR absorption of 2D C and LSPR feature of
Cuco-enhance photothermy. 2D C/Cu2 exhibits a remarkable photothermal conversion
efficiency of 65.05 %. Synergetic effect of photothermy and ion release can
effectively sterilize. 2D C/Cu shows broad-spectrum bactericidal activity
without apparent toxicity. Low photothermal conversion efficiency restricts the
antibacterial application of photothermal materials. In this work, two-
dimensional carbon nanosheets 2D C were prepared and decorated with Cu
nanoparticles 2D C/Cu by using a simple soluble salt template method combined
with ultrasonic exfoliation. The photothermal conversion efficiency of 2D C/Cu
system can be optimized by changing the content of Cu nanoparticles, where the
2D C/Cu2 showed the best photothermal conversion efficiency of 65.05 % under 808
nm near-infrared light irradiation. In addition, the photothermal performance
can affect the release behavior of Cu ions. This superior photothermal property
combined with released Cu ions can endow this 2D hybrid material with highly
efficient antibacterial efficacy of 99.97 % 0.01 %, 99.96 % 0.01 %, 99.97 % 0.01

Staphylococcus aureus, respectively, because of the synergetic effect of
photothermy and ion release. In addition, this 2D hybrid system exhibited good
cytocompatibility. Hence, this study provides a novel strategy to enhance the
photothermal performance of 2D materials and thus will be beneficial for
development of antibiotics-free antibacterial materials with safe and highly

Investigation of annealing-treatment on structural and optical properties of
sol-gel-derived zinc oxide thin films. The transparent ZnO thin films were
prepared on Si100 substrates by the sol-gel method. The structural and optical
properties of ZnO thin films, submitted to an annealing treatment in the ranges
are studied by X-ray diffraction XRD and UV-visible spectroscopic ellipsometry
SE. XRD measurements show that all the films are crystallized in the hexagonal
wurtzite phase and present a random orientation. Three prominent peaks,
corresponding to the 100 phase 2 31.8, 002 phase 2 34.5, and 110 phase 2 36.3
appear on the diffractograms. The crystallite size increases with increasing
annealing temperature. These modifications influence the optical properties. The
optical constants and thickness of the films have been determined by analysing
the SE spectra. The optical bandgap has been determined from the extinction
coefficient. We found that the refractive index and the extinction coefficient
increase with increasing annealing temperature. The optical bandgap energy
decreases with increasing annealing temperature. These mean that the optical
quality of ZnO films is improved by annealing.

Inhomogeneous deformation of {111}&lt;uvw&gt; grain in cold rolled tantalum. The
microstructures of {111} grain were characterized in detailed and systematically
investigated with the aid of electron backscatter diffraction EBSD and
transmission electron microscope TEM. The stored energy in different regions in
the grain was evaluated by the band contrast values collected from EBSD. The
results show that the distribution of energy is inhomogeneous through the grain.
Especially, the regions containing the least and the largest energy were
extracted from the EBSD data, and then quantitatively analyzed based on the
misorientation and Schmid factor. Many peaks with large misorientation appeared
in the region containing larger energy, and these peaks represent the existences
of micro-bands and micro-shear bands in {111} grain. The results of Schmid
factor suggest that the region containing larger energy is prone to deforming
ahead of the region with less stored energy, implying the more serious
subdivision of the microstructure of region with larger stored energy.

Effect of Nb on dynamic strain induced austenite to ferrite transformation.
Dynamic strain induced transformation DSIT is an interesting processing route to
obtain ultrafine ferrite grains. In the present work, the effect of Nb on DSIT
was investigated. Samples of low CMn steels, with and without Nb, were
intensively deformed in hot torsion, aiming at the production of ultrafine
ferrite grains. After soaking at, the samples were cooled to, submitted to hot
torsion deformation to decrease the grain size and then cooled to 900, 850 or
for further hot torsion deformation. In the steel without Nb, recrystallisation
took place before enough deformation could be accumulated to induce ferrite
formation, so DSIT would only take place at the lowest temperature
investigated,. In the Nb steel, Nb addition delayed austenite recrystallisation,
allowing DSIT ferrite to form at higher temperature than in the steel without
Nb,.

Layer-by-layer assembly of gold nanoparticles and cysteamine on gold electrode
for immunosensing of human chorionic gonadotropin at picogram levels. The
development of an electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of human
chorionic gonadotropin hCG is described with a limit of detection as low as 0.3
pg mL-1 in phosphate buffer. In this immunosensor, cysteamine Cys and gold
nanoparticles AuNPs were used to immobilize an anti-hCG monoclonal antibody onto
a gold electrode GE. The structure of AuNPs has been confirmed by EDS, SEM, and
TEM analysis. Due to the large specific surface area and excellent electrical
conductivity of AuNPs, electron transfer was promoted and the amount of hCG
antibody was enhanced significantly. A systematic study on the effects of
experimental parameters such as pH, incubation time in the hCG solution and urea
solution used for experiments on the binding between the immobilized antibody
and hCG has been carried out. Under optimal experimental parameters,
differential pulse voltammetry DPV signal changes of the FeCN63-/4- are used to
detect hCG with two broad linear ranges: 0.001 to 0.2 and 0.2 to 60.7 ng mL-1.
The LOD value proves more sensitive in comparison with previously reported
methods. The prepared immunosensor showed high sensitivity and stability. In
addition, the immunosensor was successfully used for the determination of hCG in
human serum.

Size Effect on Acoustic Emission Characteristics of Coal-Rock Damage Evolution.
Coal-gas outburst, rock burst, and other mine dynamic disasters are closely
related to the instability and failure of coal-rock. Coal-rock is the assemblies
of mineral particles of varying sizes and shapes bonded together by cementing
materials. The damage and rupture process of coal-rock is accompanied by
acoustic emission AE, which can be used as an effective means to monitor and
predict the instability of coal-rock body. In this manuscript, considering the
size effect of coal-rock, the influence of different height to diameter ratio on
the acoustic emission characteristics of coal-rock damage evolution was
discussed by microparticle flow <mml:math

software platform. The results show that coal-rock size influences the uniaxial
compressive strength, peak strain, and elastic modulus of itself; the size
effect has little effect on the acoustic emission law of coal-rock damage and
the effects of the size of coal-rock samples on acoustic emission
characteristics are mainly reflected in three aspects: the triggering time of
acoustic emission, the strain range of strong acoustic emission, and the
intensity of acoustic emission; the damage evolution of coal-rock specimen can
be divided into 4 stages: initial damage, stable development, accelerated
development, and damage.

High Resistance Porous Pieces Obtained by PM, Reinforced with Metallic Yarns.
The paper presents the results of the experiment in the fields of new
technologies of obtaining PM reinforced with metallic yarns pieces. This type of
high resistance porous pieces are made from a base part from recovered low
alloyed steel or iron powder reinforced in the border zone with high alloyed
steel yarns. For the reinforcing have been used solid yarns 0,3 mm and mixed
yarns 0,45 mm. There have been obtained parallelipipedic samples reinforced with
four yarns placed as in fig.1.1. The samples have been pressed atMPa pressure.
The pressing has been made orthogonal onto the placement direction of the yarns.
The compacting has been made in an unidirectional compression mould with section
of 7x51mm. The sintering was made at 1200 degree Celsius in an argon medium. The
sintered samples have densities of 5,72g/cm3 pressed at 300MPa and 6,72 g/cm3
pressed at 600MPa. There have been made mechanical bending tests. There were
obtained bending strengths i=490800 MPa. From the things previously presented it
can be observed that this type of reinforced with yarns pieces have high bending
strength, though they have high porosity low density.

Study on the Life-Cycle Health Monitoring Technology of Water-Rich Loess Tunnel.
The engineering properties of water-rich loess tunnel will decline sharply
because of the existence of water, which threats the safety and stability of the
tunnel seriously. In order to ensure the safety and stability of the Qiaoyuan
tunnel, the life-cycle health monitoring was measured by the vibrating wire
sensor and distributed optical fiber. The contact pressure, shotcrete stress,
stress of steel arch rib, and strain states of the secondary liner were
evaluated. The results of the life-cycle health monitoring demonstrated that the
construction procedure, irrigation, and heavy rainfall significantly affected
the mechanics morphology of the support structure. In particular, under the
influence of irrigation, the shotcrete stress of the left shoulder had risen to
6.21 MPa from 5.30 MPa. Affordable maximum tensile stress of the right shotcrete
is 2.15 MPa, which caused the cracking of primary support structure with a crack
width of 3 mm to 8 mm. After irrigation and heavy rainfall, the stress of steel
arch rib of the left haunch had risen to 135.7 MPa and 298.7 MPa, respectively.
In addition, the strain of secondary liner rose to 1498 from 1278 continuously
at the right sidewall on section YK9 + 685, presenting that the crack was still
developing. It indicates that the vibrating wire sensor and the distributed
optical fiber were successful in achieving the life-cycle health monitoring of
water-rich loess tunnel. This technique has a significant impact on formulating
the maintaining measures and reducing the risk of tunnel.

Thermomechanical treatment of a low carbon CrNiMo steel. The influence of
thermomechanical treatments TMT has been studied in a low carbon CrNiMo steel.
With equal amounts of total plastic deformation of austenite, LTMT,e. low
temperature 550C TMT and HTMT,e. high temperature 900C TMT, produced nearly
equal martensite lath size. However, LTMT produced higher strength levels
compared with that produced by HTMT. The superior strength of L60%,e. after 60%
deformation by LTMT, is attributed to the presence of fine alloy carbides which
were absent in H60%,e. after 60% deformation by HTMT. The strength of C60% 60%
deformation by combined TMT,e. 37.5% deformation at followed by 37.5%
deformation at approached that of L60%. The final microstructures of C60% and
L60% were similar as regards precipitate size and distribution, lath size, etc.,
before and after tempering. The higher strength of C60% has been attributed to
the presence of prior cellular structure which enhances the precipitation and
extent of dislocation multiplication during and after deformation of austenite
at. After tempering at and for 2 hours the conventional material showed coarse
acicular precipitation of cementite whereas L60% indicated random distribution
of fine alloy carbides. On tempering at for 2 hours the extent of recovery in
conventional material was higher compared with that of C60%. On the basis of
these observations the strengthening mechanisms have been discussed.

High/very high cycle fatigue behaviors of medium carbon pearlitic wheel steels
and the effects of microstructure and non-metallic inclusions. The high cycle
fatigue HCF and very high cycle fatigue VHCF behaviors of medium carbon
pearlitic wheel steels were investigated by the combination of conventional
tension-compression fatigue test up to 108 cycles, frequency of 150 Hz and
ultrasonic fatigue test up to 109 cycles, frequency of 20 kHz. In the SN curves,
fatigue limit plateaus were found in the range of 107108 cycles for the
conventional fatigue test and in the range of 108109 cycles for the ultrasonic
fatigue test. No fatigue failures were found in the VHCF regime. The fatigue
fractures were mainly originated from the surface matrix of specimens, and a
small amount of fracture origins were the surface/subsurface inclusions or
internal inclusions. Only oxide inclusions were found to cause fatigue fracture,
while crack initiation was not found to be associated with sulfides in this
work. The effects of pearlite block size and inclusion size on the fatigue
strength were discussed based on the Murakami model. The fatigue limit was
slightly improved by the grain size refinement, but was insensitive to
inclusions. The main reason was that the sizes of most inclusions in the tested
steels were smaller than the critical size, below which fatigue failure can
hardly occur from inclusions. When most of the oxides were enveloped in
sulfides, the fatigue properties, however, were not obviously improved. This is
because the sizes of those oxides encapsulated by sulfides were substantially
smaller than the critical inclusion size, while large-sized oxides were not
found to be encapsulated by sulfides. Compared to the conventional high strength
steels with the tensile strength beyond 1200 MPa, the lower sensitivity of
fatigue behavior to inclusions was found in the studied steels, mainly due to
the larger critical inclusion sizes.

was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry DSC. The reaction
mechanism which TPP acts as a cross-linker is verified by the experiment of

Temperature dependence of tensile behavior of Ni-based superalloy M951. Tensile
properties of M951 alloy are shown to be significantly dependent on temperatures
in this study. Like in other superalloys, the yield and tensile strengths
decreased slightly between room temperature and 600 degrees C, then both
strengths showed peak values at intermediate temperatures, and both decreased
sharply above 850 degrees C. The elongation fluctuated with temperature with its
minimum at 800 degrees C. The TEM observations showed that at low temperature
the dominant deformation mechanism was gamma' shearing by dislocation pairs and
slip bands. At high temperature, the deformation was dominated by gamma' by-
pass. At intermediate temperature it showed a transition from gamma' shearing to
by-passing. C2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

precipitation: Deformation regulator in metastable titanium alloys. The
deformation mechanism of a binary metastable titanium alloy Ti15Mo that had been
subjected to various heat treatment regimes was investigated in this work.
Microstructures and diffuse streaks were revealed using electron back-scattered
diffraction EBSD and transmission electron microscopy TEM. The evolution of the
deformation mechanisms were identified as being from primary and secondary {332}

slips dislocation slips with varying initial microstructures. The diffuse
streaks corresponding to the soft-phonon shuffling along the {110} direction
were caused by the substitutional Mo atoms and their local strain fields. These
nano-sized modulated structures were strongly influenced by phase stability and
also proved to serve as a critical factor in deformation mechanisms of this
material. Meanwhile, the preferential growth of a nano-sized modulated structure
variant took place and was studied to highlight the relationship between loading
direction and grain orientation.

Cooling rate effects on the crystallization kinetics of polypropylene/date palm
fiber composite materials. Non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of
polypropylene/date palm fiber PP/DPF composite materials were investigated in
this study, using the differential scanning calorimetry DSC method. Different
fiber contents and cooling rates, varying from/min to/min, were considered. The
obtained results indicated that the initial crystallization temperature
increases with the increase of the DPF content. This was attributed to the
nucleating ability of these fibers. Several theoretical models were used to
predict the non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of the materials considered
in this study. Basically, it was shown that both the Avrami analysis, modified
by Jeziorny, and the method developed by Mo could adequately describe such
kinetics. The activation energies required during the overall crystallization
process and at different amounts of the relative degree of crystallinity were
also evaluated using the Kissinger method and the isoconversional analysis of
calorimetric data, respectively. It was shown that the presence of thein the PP
matrix decreases these energies, confirming their nucleating ability during the
non-isothermal crystallization process.

Bond behaviour of GFRP reinforced geopolymer cement concrete. Bond plays a key
role in the performance of reinforced concrete structures. Glass fibre
reinforced polymer GFRP reinforcing bar and Geopolymer cement GPC concrete are
promising alternative construction materials for steel bars and Ordinary
Portland Cement OPC concrete respectively. In this study, the bond behaviour
between these two materials is investigated by using beam-end specimen tests.
The bond behaviour of 15.9 mm diameter sand-coated GFRP bar was investigated. An
embedment length of six and nine times the bar diameter were used. The free end
and the loaded end bond-slip-relationships, the bond failure mode and the
average bond stress were used to analyse each of the specimens. Additionally,
the distribution of tensile and bond stress along the embedment length was
investigated by installing strain gauges along the embedment length in some of
the specimens. Test results indicate that a significant difference exists
between the free end and loaded end bond-slip curves, which is due to the lower
elastic modulus of the GFRP bars. Furthermore, it was found that the tensile and
bond stress distribution along the embedment length is nonlinear and the
nonlinearity changes with the load.

Superconducting atmospheric structure and pressure-induced novel phases of
cobalt mononitride. The study of Cobalt mononitride CoN is of significant
interest due to its excellent physical and mechanical properties as well as
potential applications in magnetic storage and superconductive materials. In
this work, we found that the ambient-pressure phase of ZnS-type CoN is
superconductive with a superconducting critical temperature of. In addition to
the superconductive nature of CoN at ambient pressure, we have also performed
structure searches with the aim of identifying high-pressure phases of CoN, as a
result, where an orthorhombic phase Pmc21 and a hexagonal phase P63 are found to
become energetically more favorable than ZnS-type phase under high pressure. The
dynamical and mechanical stabilities of predicted phases have been verified by
calculating their phonons and elastic constants, indicating they are likely to
be synthesized and recovered to ambient condition. The present results reveal
that the CoN compound can be used as hard and superconductive materials,
providing a broad prospect for practical applications.

Improvement by cerium and yttrium ion implantation of the oxidation behaviour of
ar25NiNiobium-stabilized stainless steel in CO2. The influence of the
implantation of 10e + ions cm 2 and 10 17 Y + ions cm 2 has been examined on the
early stages of scale development onr-25Ni niobium-stabilized stainless steel
where the chromium and nickel contents are given in approximate weight percent
during oxidation in CO2 at. Following successively increasing exposure periods
from 5 min to 153 h, the oxygen uptakes were measured by nuclear reaction
analysis, the locations of the implanted atoms were determined by Rutherford
back-scattering, and the compositions of the multi-component oxide scales which
developed were followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and glancing-angle
X-ray diffraction. The implanted cerium and yttrium atoms became incorporated in
the oxide scale as discrete oxide grains to reduce the attack of ther-25NiNb
steel, and the possible mechanisms involved are discussed.

Mechanical properties of as cast microalloyed steels containing V, Nb and Ti.
Tensile, hardness and room temperature Charpy V notch impact tests were used to
evaluate the variations in the mechanical properties of a low carbon cast steel
containing combinations of vanadium, niobium and titanium in the as cast
condition. Tensile and hardness test results indicate that good combinations of
strength and ductility can be achieved by microalloying additions. Based on the
TEM studies, random and interphase fine scale microalloy precipitates play a
major role in the strengthening of the microalloyed heats. However, the presence
of titanium leads to some reduction in the strength of the microalloyed heat.
Coarse TiN particles can be responsible for this behaviour. On the other hand,
microalloying additions significantly decrease the impact energy and lead to the
dominance of cleavage facets on the fracture surfaces. It seems that
heterogeneous nucleation of microalloy carbonitrides on dislocations along with
coarse ferrite grains and pearlite colonies has triggered the brittle frac...

Finite element analysis of the effect of the inner corner angle in equal channel
angular pressing. The inner corner angle ICA is one of the major factors
affecting deformation homogeneity in workpieces during equal channel angular
pressing ECAP. In this study, the effect of the ICA on the plastic deformation
behavior in ECAP was investigated using the finite element method. A round ICA
induces highly inhomogeneous deformation in the head, tail, top and bottom
regions of the workpiece due to increasing compressive and decreasing shear
deformation components. It was found that a round inner corner with an angle up
to 9 is acceptable in finite element simulations for reproducing a sharp inner
corner. These results can serve as a design guide for processing and dies of
ECAP.

Direct observation of strain in bulk subgrains and dislocation walls by high
angular resolution three-dimensional X-ray diffraction. The X-ray diffraction
XRD method high angular resolution 3DXRD is briefly introduced, and results are
presented for a single bulk grain in a polycrystalline copper sample deformed in
tension. It is found that the three-dimensional reciprocal-space intensity
distribution of a 400 reflection associated with the grain, shows a distinct
structure consisting of sharp bright peaks superimposed on a cloud of enhanced
intensity. The bright peaks which arise from individual subgrains are found to
be subjected to backward strain on average while the fraction of the material
giving rise to the cloud of enhanced intensity is subjected to forward strain.
Based on the latter observation the, originally tentative, interpretation of the
cloud as arising from dislocation walls is substantiated.

The Nucleation and Propagation of Threading Dislocations with CComponent of
Burgers Vector in PVT-Grown 4HSiC. Studies of threading dislocations with
Burgers vector of c+a have been carried out using synchrotron white beam X-ray
topography. The nucleation and propagation of pairs of opposite sign threading
c+a dislocations is observed. Overgrowth of inclusions by growth steps leads to
lattice closure failure and the stresses associated with this can be relaxed by
the nucleation of opposite sign pairs of dislocations with Burgers vector c+a.
Once these dislocations are nucleated they propagate along the c-axis growth
direction, or can be deflected onto the basal plane by overgrowth of macrosteps.
For the c+a dislocations, partial deflection can occasionally occur, e.g. the
a-component deflects onto basal plane while the c-component continuously
propagates along the growth direction. One factor controlling the details of
these deflection processes is suggested to be related to the ratio between the
height of the overgrowing macrostep and that of the surface spiral hillock
associated with the threading growth dislocations with c-component of Burgers
vector.

Electrochemical fabrication of TiO2 nanoparticles/BMIMBF4 ionic liquid hybrid
film electrode and its application in determination of p-acetaminophen. A water
soluble ionic liquid, 1butyl3methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate BMIMBF 4 , was
incorporated into TiO2 nanoparticles to fabricate a hybrid film modified glassy
carbon electrode nanoTiO 2 /BMIMBF 4 /GCE through electrochemical deposition in
a tetrabutyltitanate sol solution containing BMIMBF 4 . The obtained nanoTiO 2
/BMIMBF 4 /GCEs were characterized scanning electronic microscopy SEM and X ray
photoelectron spectroscopy XPS. Electrochemical behaviors of p acetaminophen at
the nanoTiO 2 /BMIMBF 4 /GCEs were thoroughly investigated. Compared to the
redox reaction of p acetaminophen using an unmodified electrode under the same
conditions, a new reduction peak was observed clearly at 0.26 V with the
modified electrode. In addition, the peak potential for the oxidation of p
acetaminophen was found to shift negatively about 90 mV and the current response
increased significantly. These changes indicate that the nanoTiO 2 /BMIMBF 4
hybrid film can improve the redox reactions of p acetaminophen in aqueous
medium. Under optimum conditions, a linear relationship was obtained for the p
acetaminophen solutions with concentration in the range from 5.0 10 8 to 5.0 10
5 M. The estimated detection limit was 1.0 10 8 M S/N = 3. The newly developed
method was applied for the determination of p- acetaminophen in urine samples.
Nano-TiO2 /BMIMBF 4 hybrid film electrode was fabricated with electrodeposition.
Voltammetric behavior of p -acetaminophen at the obtained electrode was
investigated. The hybrid film electrode shows good electrocatalytic response to
p -acetaminophen. p -acetaminophen in urine samples was successfully determined.

Highly dispersed Pd clusters/nanoparticles encapsulated invia in situ auto-
reduction method for aqueous phenol hydrogenation. An in situ auto-reduction
strategy is developed to encapsulate Pd clusters. Amino groups inanchor
formaldehyde to form reducing groups. Pd2+ ions are in situ auto-reduced to
metallic Pd clusters/nanoparticles. Pd/MIL-125-NH2 exhibits high phenol
conversion and cyclohexanone selectivity. Other MOF-supported metals can be
prepared by the in situ auto-reduction method. In this work, a novel in situ
auto-reduction strategy was developed to encapsulate uniformly dispersed Pd
clusters/nanoparticles in MIL-125-NH2 . It is demonstrated that the amino groups
in MIL-125-NH2 can react with formaldehyde to form novel reducing groups
-NHCH2OH, which can in situ auto-reduce the encapsulated Pd2+ ions to metallic
Pd clusters/nanoparticles.no additional reductants are required, the strategy
limits the aggregation and migration of Pd clusters and the formation of large
Pd nanoparticles via controlling the amount of Pd2+ precursor. When applied as
catalysts in the hydrogenation of phenol in the aqueous phase, the obtained
Pd1.5/MIL-125-NHCH2OH catalyst with highly dispersed Pd clusters/nanoparticles
with the size of around 2 nm exhibited 100% of phenol conversion and 100% of
cyclohexanone selectivity at after 5 h, as well as remarkable reusability for at
least five cycles due to the large MOF surface area, the highly dispersed Pd
clusters/nanoparticles and their excellent stability within the MIL-125-NHCH2OH
framework.

Polytypism in mcalpineite: a study of natural and synthetic Cu3TeO6. Synthetic
and naturally occurring forms of tricopper orthotellurate, CuII3TeVIO6 the
mineral mcalpineite have been investigated by 3D electron diffraction 3D ED,
X-ray powder diffraction XRPD, Raman and infrared IR spectroscopic
measurements.a result of the diffraction analyses, CuII3TeVIO6 is shown to occur
in two polytypes. The higher-symmetric CuII3TeVIO6-1C polytype is cubic, space
group Ia3, with a = 9.537 1 and V = 867.4 3 3 as reported in previous studies.
The polytype is a well characterized structure consisting of alternating layers
of CuIIO6 octahedra and both CuIIO6 and TeVIO6 octahedra in a patchwork
arrangement. The structure of the lower-symmetric orthorhombic CuII3TeVIO6-2O
polytype was determined for the first time in this study by 3D ED and verified
by Rietveld refinement. The 2O polytype crystallizes in space group Pcca, with a
= 9.745 3 , b = 9.749 2 , c = 9.771 2 and V = 928.3 4 3. High-precision XRPD
data were also collected on CuII3TeVIO6-2O to verify the lower-symmetric
structure by performing a Rietveld refinement. The resultant structure is
identical to that determined by 3D ED, with unit-cell parameters a = 9.56157 19
, b = 9.55853 11 , c = 9.62891 15 and V = 880.03 2 3. The lower symmetry of the
2O polytype is a consequence of a different cation ordering arrangement, which
involves the movement of every second CuIIO6 and TeVIO6 octahedral layer by
1/4/, 1/4/, 0, leading to an offset of TeVIO6 and CuIIO6 octahedra in every
second layer giving an ABAB* stacking arrangement. Syntheses of CuII3TeVIO6
showed that low-temperature 473 K hydrothermal conditions generally produce the
2O polytype. XRPD measurements in combination with Raman spectroscopic analysis
showed that most natural mcalpineite is the orthorhombic 2O polytype. Both XRPD
and Raman spectroscopy measurements may be used to differentiate between the two
polytypes of CuII3TeVIO6. InRaman spectroscopy, CuII3TeVIO6-1C has a single
strong band around 730 cm-1, whereas CuII3TeVIO6-2O shows a broad double maximum
with bands centred around 692 and 742 cm-1.

Analyses of lattice and shape deformations and of atomic shuffles in martensitic
transformation. Some ambiguities in the conventional crystallographic analysis
of the atomic displacements during martensite formation into lattice and lattice
invariant deformations and atomic shuffles are discussed with reference to the
choice of lattice correspondence. Transformations in metals and alloys are
divided into four basic structural classes, and various suggested precursors to
transformation are discussed for each category. The view is advanced that
nucleation at defects and growth by migration of interfaces is an essential
mechanistic feature of all martensitic transformations and that lattice
instabilities, elastic and phonon softening, tweed microstructures etc. are not
necessary precursors to transformation.

An assessment of some post-yield fracture criteria. The physical significance
and the relationship between the J integral and crack tip opening displacement
are discussed. For fast failure, a criterion based upon J is appropriate, whilst
for time dependent phenomena the crack tip opening displacement is suitable. The
meaning of J within the framework of dislocation models is discussed. It is
shown that a critical value of J at fracture coincides with the maxima in the
total energy, and the assumptions inherent in proposing a fracture criterion
based upon J are outlined. The physical significance of J as defined, and used,
in elastic-plastic and non-linear elastic continuum calculations is assessed.
The experimental evidence suggesting that the value of J at the onset of fast
fracture may be geometry dependent is discussed.

Mechanical behaviour of a bimodal microstructured powder metallurgy Ni3Al. The

education followed by one stress free thermal cycle to check the TWME or twenty
consecutive thermomechanical cycles followed by one or two checking thermal
cycles. The capacity of the trained specimen for producing work under an
antagonist compressive stress is also studied and the behaviour of the
deformation of the specimen under such a condition at different temperatures is
analysed in terms of a competition between the contributions of the different
variants: trained variants with an intrinsic deformation in the direction of the
tensile stress of the training process, trained variants with an intrinsic
deformation which is not well orientated with respect to this direction in the
polycrystal and new variants with an intrinsic deformation in the direction of
the compressive stress which can replace the educated variants.

A study on sodium - the fast breeder reactor coolant. Sodium, the second alkali
metal in the first group of periodic table is highly chemically reactive. Sodium
is widely used in pharmaceutical industries to manufacture lifesaving medicines.
Liquid sodium is an excellent reducing agent and heat transport medium, which
makes it an important industrial material. The application of this element in
liquid form at high temperature as a coolant in fast breeder nuclear reactors
necessitated development of sodium technology. Physical, chemical and nuclear
properties of sodium led to the choice of sodium as the universally accepted
fast breeder reactor FBR coolant. The manufacturing of sodium is by electrolysis
process. The design and manufacturing requirements of high temperature liquid
sodium system components are successfully addressed. Special type of sensors
needed for high temperature liquid sodium system are specifically designed and
developed. Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research IGCAR, Kalpakkam is involved
in the development of sodium technology in India. Sodium technology is matured
to an extent and around twentywith sodium as the coolant were constructed,
commissioned and successfully operated all over the world. Five sodium cooled
fast reactors are currently in operation including fast breeder test reactor
FBTR in India. Prototype fast breeder reactor PFBR is in the advanced stage of
commissioning at Kalpakkam. This review paper explains the choice of sodium as
FBR coolant and gives highlights on the research and development took place in
sodium technology all over the world especially in India with an aim to give an
exposure to this technology to the academic community.

Study on the Granularity Effect of Micronized Starch and Its Rheological
Property. The corn starch granules can be micronized by the modern powder
machine.Along with the decrease of the starch granules size,the Intrinsic
Viscosities of amylose and amylopectin declined,which indicated the decrease of
starch molecular weight.The Brabender Viscosity Cures showed,along with the
decrease of the granularity,the beginning gelatinizing temperature of MST
declines,the hot stability is enhanced and the cold stability
decreases.Rheological analyzing results show the MST paste is pseudoplastic
fluid.After micronizating,the fluidity of MST paste increases.The granularity
effect has obvious influence on the rheological properties of corn starch.

A transient dynamic process in a structural nonlinear system beam two-parameter
foundation. A method for analytical assessment of dynamic added stress in
elastic loaded beam resting on elastic two-parameter Pasternaks foundation due
to sudden destruction a part of foundation is proposed. Equations of static
bending, natural and forced oscillations are written in a matrix form using
state vectors including deflection, rotational angles, bending moments, and
shear forces at arbitrary cross section of a beam and also using the matrices of
the initial parameters influence on the stress-strain state in arbitrary cross
section. The influence of foundation failure on beams stress-strain state,
taking into account a relation between the stiffness parameters of foundation,
is analyzed. The condition of smallness for the shear stiffness parameter
Pasternaks parameter in comparison with the stretching-compressing stiffness
parameter Vinklers parameter is accepted. It is shown that the accounting of
Pasternaks parameter reduces the level of dynamic added stress in a beam when
sudden destructing of a foundation. The factor of sudden defect occurrence in
the system beam foundation increases considerably the internal forces in a beam
in comparison with quasistatic formation of the same defect.

First-principles investigations of structural, electronic and thermoelectric
properties of Sb/Bi2Se3 van der Waals heterostructure. Herein, we report first-
principles calculations combined with the semi-classical Boltzmann theory in
order to highlight the great thermoelectric potential of Sb/Bi2Se3 van der Waals
vdW heterostructure. The electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of
Sb and Bi2Se3 monolayers, and Sb/Bi2Se3 heterostructure have been investigated.
The predicted results exhibited all studied materials present a semiconducting
behavior, with band gaps found to be E g = 1.29 , 0.85, and 0.25eV for Sb and
Bi2Se3 monolayers and Sb/Bi2Se3 vdW heterostructure, respectively. The effect of
the temperature and chemical potential on transport properties has been
demonstrated. It is worth mentioning that the electronic figure of merit ZT e
exhibits two peaks at room temperature, with an uttermost value of 11.22 at
0.054 Ry and 11.19 at 0.044 Ry, suggesting that a remarkable value of ZT e can
be attained through n-type/p-type doping for Sb/Bi2Se3 vdW heterostructure.
Moreover, ZT e increases sharply above and reaches a value of 18.34 at for
Sb/Bi2Se3 vdW heterostructure. This finding could indicate a good future
thermoelectric potential to integrate this of this Sb/Bi2Se3 heterostructure
into the application of clean electric energy production.

Effect of Collagen/Ibuprofen Hydrogel in Wound Healing: An InVivo Study.
Background and Aim. Wound healing is a complicated physiological process to
preserve skin integrity after injuries and includes the proliferative phase,
hemostasis/inflammatory phase, and remodeling through extracellular,
intercellular, and intracellular components synchronization. The study aimed to
examine human placental collagen/ibuprofens effect on wound healing in an animal
model. Materials and Methods. The cell viability test was performed by MTT
3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. In this
animal study, three circular excisions were made in the back of each of the 12
rats and injected with the following groups: collagen/ibuprofen, group 1;
collagen, group 2; and unfilled as the control group, group 3 for two times. The
healing procedures were explored via calculating wound contraction percentage
after taking photographs on days 7 and 14. Also, histopathological assessments
were conducted on days 7 and 14. Results. The MTT results showed no significant
cytotoxicity, and macroscopic results demonstrated that the percentage of wound
contraction was 85%, 79%, and 41% in the collagen/ibuprofen, collagen, and
control groups on 14th day, respectively. Histopathological assessments showed
that hair follicles number, fibroblasts content, and angiogenesis in the
collagen/ibuprofen were remarkably more significant than collagen and control
groups. Conclusion. The collagen/ibuprofen group had significant outcomes
compared with collagen and the control groups in wound healing and wound
contraction. Collagen/ibuprofen hydrogel can be a potential hydrogel in
accelerating wound healing.

Adsorption of Lanthanum 3+-Iron 3+-Doped Waste Coal Fly Ash Composite Adsorbent
for Reactive Dyes from Aqueous Solution. A composite adsorbent La/Fe/FA for
reactive turquoise blue KN-G RTB KN-G and reactive brilliant blue KN-R RBB KN-R
removal from aqueous solution was prepared by loading lanthanum 3+ and iron 3+
onto waste coal fly ash FA. The adsorption behavior of RTB KN-G and RBB KN-R on
La/Fe/FA was investigated systematically. The results show that the initial dye
concentration, contact time, pH value and temperature are all the important
factors influencing the adsorption. The adsorption of La/Fe/FA for two reactive
dyes at different temperatures were very fast and can establish sorption
equilibrium at 30min, and agreed well with pseudo-second-order kinetics. The
equilibrium adsorption data could be described by the Langmuir isotherm equation
well, and obtained maximum adsorption capacities at were 56.28 mg/g for RTB KN-G
and 116.82mg/g for RBB KN-R, respectively. The rise of temperature was not
conducive to adsorption. The results show that the La/Fe/FA adsorbent displays
high effective adsorption for reactive dyes and will have potential as a
promising application in the field of water pollution control and recycling
utilization of resources.

Marangoni Convection and Fragmentation in LASER Treatment. Epitaxial Laser Metal
Forming E-LMF consists in impinging a jet of metallic powder onto a molten pool
formed by controlled laser heating and thereby, generating epitaxially a single
crystal deposit onto a single crystal substrate. It is a near net-shape process
for rapid prototyping or repair engineering of single crystal high pressure/high
temperature gas turbines blades. Single crystal repair using E-LMF requires
controlled solidification conditions in order to prevent the nucleation and
growth of crystals ahead of the columnar dendritic front,e., to ensure epitaxial
growth and to avoid the columnar to equiaxed transition. A major limitation to
the process lies in the formation of stray grains which can originate either
from heterogeneous nucleation ahead of the solidification front or from
remelting of dendrite arms due to local solute enriched liquid flow, .i.e
fragmentation. To study this last aspect, heat and fluid flow modelling is
required to establish the relationship between process parameters such as laser
power, beam diameter and scanning speed, and the local solidification conditions
plus the fluid flow in the vicinity of the mushy zone. Surface tension driven
convection known as the Marangoni effect needs to be included in the model owing
to its large influence on the development of eddies and on the shape of the
liquid pool. The 3D model implemented in the FE software calcosoft is used to
compute the fluid convection within the liquid pool and to assess the risk of
fragmentation using a criterion based on the local velocity field and thermal
gradient. The computed results are compared with EBSD maps of laser traces
carried out at EPF-Lausanne in re-melting experiments.

Improvements in the heteroepitaxial growth of GaAs on Si by MOVPE. We describe
methods of improving the metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy MOVPE growth of
heteroepitaxial GaAs on Si. The low temperature growth step at the start is
optimized by using the new alternative group III precursor dimethylethyl-amine-
gallane GaH3NCH32H5 DMEAGa as a substitute for the conventional group III
compound TMGa. Further improvements in surface morphology and X-ray diffraction
linewidth are obtained by applying the modulated atomic layer epitaxy ALE for
this growth step. Thermal cycle annealing which is much more effective in
dislocation reduction than constant temperature annealing has been optimized
with respect to the high as well as the low temperature steps. We present a
model of low temperature behaviour of dislocations to explain the role of
cooling the samples during thermal cycle annealing. An additional improvement of
layer quality is achieved by introducing a thin AlGaAs-layer after the low-
temperature-GaAs-layer leading to a confinement of dislocations after performing
thermal cycle annealing as established by TEM-investigations.

Fracture Simulation for Cement Mortar Reinforced by FRP on The Surface.. When a
load is applied to a structure reinforced by composite materials, the mechanical
behavior is different from the one without composites.the technology in which
the surface of structure is reinforced by fiber reinforced plastics FRP is used
widely to prohibit the reduction of strength caused by cracking, it is necessary
to establish the method of fracture simulation applicable to the reinforced
structure. Therefore, a computer program of fracture simulation for the cement
mortar reinforced by CFRP or AFRP has been developed in this paper. In order to
evaluate the computational results, three point bending tests on mortar beams
were carried out. The cement mortar beams whose surface is reinforced by FRP
sheet are superior in strength to those of cement mortar only. The computational
results have a good agreement with the experimental ones.a result, it is clear
that the developed computer program of fracture simulation is very useful for
design of structures with composites.

A novel high color purity blue-emitting phosphor: CaBi2B2O7:Tm3+. A series of
Tm3+ -doped CaBi2 x B2O7 : x Tm3+0.02 x 0.12 blue-emitting phosphors with high
color purity were prepared by solid-state reaction method. The crystal structure
and luminescence properties of the as-prepared phosphors were studied. This
phosphor shows a satisfactory blue performance peak at 453nm due to the 1 D 2 3
F4 transition of Tm3+ excited by 357nm light. Investigation of Tm3+ content
dependent emission spectra indicates that x =0.04 is the optimum doping content
of Tm3+ ions in the CaBi2B2O7 host. The critical distance and the concentration
quenching mechanism were also investigated. In particular, the color purity of
as prepared sample was analyzed and the result shows that the color purity of
CaBi2B2O7 :Tm 3+ is higher than the commercial blue phosphor BaMgAl10O17 :Eu 2+

Characterization of 6HSiC JFET Integrated Circuits over a Broad Temperature
Range from -150 C to +500 C. The NASA Glenn Research Center has previously
reported prolonged stable operation of simple prototype 6HSiC JFET integrated
circuits logic gates and amplifier stages for thousands of hours at +500 C. This
paper experimentally investigates the ability of these 6HSiC JFET devices and
integrated circuits to also function at cold temperatures expected to arise in
some envisioned applications. Prototype logic gateexperimentally demonstrated
good functionality down to -125 C without changing circuit input voltages.
Cascaded operation of gates at cold temperatures was verified by externally
wiring gates together to form a 3-stage ring oscillator. While logic gate output
voltages exhibited little change across the broad temperature range from -125 C
to +500 C, the change in operating frequency and power consumption of these non-
optimized logic gates as a function of temperature was much larger and tracked
JFET channel conduction properties.

infrared spectral region. The responsivity of the photovoltaic cell is enhanced
from 0.18A/W0.5 A/W to 0.85 A/W to 0.25A/W, this means that the conversion
efficiency increases from about 9% to about 14% due to irradiation effect. All
treatments and measurements have been done at room temperature. The observed
enhancement is related to the appearing of nano-structured groves in thenm

Imaging of Fatigue Cracks in Aluminum Alloy by Micro Computed Tomography with
Synchrotron Radiation. The authors have applied micro computed tomography CT
with synchrotron radiation of SPring-8 to imaging of fatigue cracks in cast
aluminum alloy AC4CH. Theoretical evaluation showed that the edge of a sample
apart from an X-ray detector was enhanced in the radiographic image due to the
refraction of X-rays. The edge enhancement was confirmed with 28keV
monochromatic X-ray under the arrangement where the detector was set behind the
sample by 800mm. The enhancement also appeared on the tomographic image
reconstructed by FBP filtered back projection algorithm. The fatigue cracks were
clearly observed in both reconstructed images of laser-peened and unpeened
samples. The crack image of the unpeened sample was evidently larger than that
of the laser-peened sample, which implies that laser peening retarded the
fatigue crack propagation.

Evaluation of the contact angle in rapid solidification by melt spinning. This
paper presents an experimental method for the estimation of the contact angle in
processing metallic glasses, based on a modeling scheme of the viscosity
temperature dependence of liquid alloys and a heterogeneous nucleation regime
during melt-spinning process, when rapid quenching from the liquid state may
result in the formation of either a crystalline or a glassy structure. Melt-spun
Mgu 0.4 ribbons have been obtained using two different quenching rim velocities
of 7.5 and 30.0 m s 1 , and were shown to be respectively fully crystalline and
fully amorphous. Numerical simulation has been performed, with assumed values of
45, 50 and 55 for the wetting angle, all other physical and processing
parameters kept identical. If 50 is assumed to be the contact angle for the
considered system, the ribbons processed at a substrate rim velocity of 7.5 m s
1 are predicted to be crystalline, while those processed at 30.0 m s 1 are
predicted to be amorphous. This points to the conclusion that, in this specific
case Mgu 0.4 solidifying on a CuBe substrate, the contact angle is close 4 to
50. The knowledge of the critical contact angle necessary for suppression of
nucleation and dominance of amorphization enables the correct choice of
substrate and additional processing parameters for the production of glassy
metallic material.

Analysis of the Applicability of Effective Thermophysical Properties to

FSPCMs can tailor the properties of pure This is often attained by the presence
of high-melting, high-thermal conductivity metallic phase which enhances the
thermal energy storage/release. The evaluation of the thermal response of these
composite materials in unsteady conditions, is not an easy task, and
simplifications introduced to deal with them must be carefully considered. A set
of FSPCMs of prismatic geometry with polymeric wax as PCM and an Al foam with
various pore sizes, modelled as BCC lattice has been considered in this paper.
The thermal response under a set of boundary conditions with constant heat flux
at the bottom surface, all other being adiabatic, was investigated both by
direct simulations approach modelling the two phases and the 1-temperature
model, which considers the material as homogeneous and characterized by a proper
set of effective properties. The 1-temperature model is able to closely
reproduce the whole the local thermal history only within certain validity
ranges, even if it can well reproduce the average energy storage due to the
transformation of the PCM phase.

Continuum Isotropic Elastic Model for Sintering of Ceramic Materials
<sup></sup>. In this work a sintering model that assumes infinitesimal

develop by Olevsky and Skorokhod 1, 2 and the sintering model develop by Sasan
Kiani et al. 3, 4. The model was used to estimate dimensional change and the
density distribution using linear displacement ratesas the only input.
Furthermore, if the sintering potential and dense material shear viscosity are
known, the stress distribution can be approximated. The magnitude of two stress
norms i.e. Von Misses stress and the stress tensor first invariant determined
using experimental and calculatedare compared using three different geometries.
From FEM simulation results it was inferred that densification can occur in
presence of tension stresses if their magnitude is lower than the calculated
sintering potential.

Water Absorption Properties of Cement Pastes: Experimental and Modelling
Inspections. An intermingled fractal units model is shown in order to simulate
pore microstructures as pore fraction and pore size distribution. This model is
aimed at predicting capillary water absorption coefficient and sorptivity values
in cement pastes. The results obtained are in good agreement with the
experimental ones. For validating this model, a comparison with other procedures
has been shown. It is possible to establish that the newly proposed method
matches better with the experimental results. That is probably due to the fact
that pore size distribution has been considered as a whole. Moreover, even
though the proposed model is based on fractal base units, it is able to simulate
and predict different properties as well as nonfractal porous microstructure.

The mechanism of the initiation of fish eye failure was examined by stereography
of the fracture surface of SCr420 carburized steel tested under rotating
bending. Three modes of fish eye nucleation were observed: mode I crack
initiation from nonmetallic inclusion ni, mode II crack initiation from ni
followed by the transition to mode I crack, and mode II crack initiation at the
martensitic lath interface.The mode II crack plane was close to or less inclined
than the plane of maximum shear stress. The maximum length of mode II crack was
longer when the local stress at the origin was lower. The transition from mode
II to mode I occurred at the threshold mode I stress intensity factor, KIth,
3MPam1/2/. The threshold mode II stress intensity factor for the nucleation was
estimated as KIIth1.5MPam1/2/.

EFFECT OF THE COMPOUND LUBRICANT SYSTEM ON THE TRIBOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OFPOM
RESIN. The effect of compound lubricating systems on the friction and wear
properties of POM resin was studied. The results indicate: the compound
lubricating system composed primarily of polyolefins can improve the friction
and wear properties of POM efficiently. The wearing test shows the friction
coefficient is reduced to 60%~70% that of POM, the Pv value is increased to
twice that of POM, the abrasion resistance is increased two order of magnitude,
and the wear mechanism of POM relates to ploughing, fatigue and adhesion wear.

Structural and Hydrogenation Properties of Zr0.9Ti0.1Cr1.2-xV0.8Nix x=0, 0.4
Compounds. The goal of our studies is to find alloy compositions capable of high
H capacity and reversible low temperature hydrogenation. In the present research
work, specimens with nominal compositions Zr0.9Ti0.1Cr1.2V0.8 and
Zr0.9Ti0.1Cr0.8V0.8Ni0.4 have been prepared by arcmelting under argon
atmosphere. The microstructural properties of the samples were analyzed by XRD
and SEM, while the corresponding microchemistry was determined by EDAX
measurements. A two phase system was regularly obtained, with the main component
being the hexagonal C14Laves phase. The presence of small amounts of Ni has been
found to increase the alloy activity on hydrogen. Hydrogen activation was
performed for both samples and charging-discharging properties were investigated
in the temperature range between and by using a Sievert-type apparatus.

Magnetically Controlled Grain Boundary Motion and Grain Growth in Zinc. The
motion of grain boundaries in zinc bicrystals 99.995% driven by the magnetic
driving force was investigated. Planar symmetrical and asymmetrical tilt grain
boundaries with rotation angles in the range between 60 and 90 were examined. At
a given temperature the boundary migration rate was found to increase linearly
with an applied driving force. The absolute grain boundary mobility was
determined. The boundary mobility and its temperature dependence were found to
depend on the misorientation angle and the inclination of the boundary plane. An
application of a magnetic field during the annealing of cold rolled 90%
Zn-1.1%Al sheet specimens resulted in an asymmetry of the two major texture
components. This is interpreted in terms of magnetically affected grain growth
kinetics.

Production of silicon quantum dots for photovoltaic applications by picosecond
pulsed laser ablation. Semiconductor nanocrystals exhibiting strong quantum
confinement effects have been produced by picosecond pulsed laser ablation.
Crystalline, nanometer-sized Si particles with average sizes ranging from one to
five nanometers were collected on both crystalline and glassy substrates.
Nanoparticle size can be tuned through variation of the laser pulse energy
density and by distance of the collection area from the plume center. Raman
spectra of the particles confirm the crystalline nature of the nanoparticles and
exhibit significant shifts due to phonon confinement effects. Optical absorption
spectra of Si nanoparticles show absorption onsets ranging from 1.7 eV to 3.0
eV. These properties, combined with relatively narrow measured size
distributions, make these quantum dots excellent candidates for inclusion in
nanocomposite solar cells.

Thixoforging of aluminum alloys. A new process for the forming of metal alloys
into net or near-net shapes by forging-type operations was investigated. The
process, denoted as thixoforging, uses a partially solidified, vigorously
agitated rheocast metal as initial charge material. It was shown that
intermittent operation of the slurry producer coupled with direct transfer of
the semi-solid charge to the lower die of the forging press permits production
of sound heat-treatable components that are free of entrapped oxides and which
have excellent static and dynamic properties. Commercial 2024 aluminum-base
alloy was used in the investigation. The solution heat treatment response of
rheocast ingots and the structure and properties of thixoforged parts of the
alloy were compared with conventionally solidified ingots and with forgings made
from a completely liquid initial charge respectively. It was found that the
initial spheroidal rheocast structure contains less non-equilibrium second phase
and solutionizes more rapidly than the plate-like dendritic structure. The disk-
shaped parts 0.12 m in diameter and 0.025-0.04 m high produced from both
rheocast and liquid charge materials respond to heat treatment and possess
properties comparable with those of the wrought alloy. For example, the tensile
properties of the thixoforged parts in the T-6 condition were as follows: yield
strength, approximately 35 kgf mm 2 ; ultimate tensile strength, 46.4 kgf mm 2 ;
elongation, 11.2%. These values are slightly lower than those measured on
squeeze-cast parts made in this study. The fatigue properties of the thixoforged
parts, however, were slightly superior.

Solder/substrate interfacial thermal conductance and wetting angles of BiAg
solder alloys. BiAg lead-free alloys are considered interesting alternatives to
Pb-based traditional solders due to compatible melting point and strength.
During soldering, the ability of a liquid alloy to flow or spread over the
substrate is crucial for the formation of a metallic bond driven by the
physicochemical properties of the liquid solder/solid substrate system. In
addition, the wettability is intimately associated with the solder/substrate
thermal conductance represented by a heat transfer coefficient, hi. In this
work, three BiAg alloys hypoeutectic1.5wt%Ag, eutectic2.5wt%Ag and
hypereutectic4.0wt%Ag were directionally solidified under upward unsteady state
heat flow conditions. Both time-dependent hi profiles and wetting behavior
represented by contact angles were determined for the three alloys examined. The
dependence of on the alloy Ag content is assessed experimentally. Also, thermal
readings collected during directional solidification of the Bi1.5 , 2.5 and
4.0wt% Ag alloys are used with a view to permitting hi versus time t profiles to
be computed. It is shown that along a first solidification stage t 16s the
volumetric expansion of the Bi-rich phase is shown to have a dominant role
inducing a sudden increase in hi. For each alloy a couple of time-dependent hi
expressions is needed to represent the entire solidification progress.

New insight into reaction mechanisms of TiCl4 for the synthesis of TiO2
nanoparticles in H2O-assisted atmospheric-pressure CVS process. A new deep
insight into reaction mechanisms of TiO2 nanoparticles formation in the
simultaneous oxidation/hydrolysis of TiCl4 and the impressive effects of H2O
particles were studied theoretically and experimentally. Comprehensive
thermodynamics and kinetics studies of the simultaneous hydrolysis/oxidation of
TiCl4 in the gas-phase synthesis process of TiO2 nanoparticles was confirmed by
experimental runs. By increasing the H2O amounts in H2O/O2 ratio, the titania
nanoparticles' size decreases proportionately. H2O-assisted APCVS process was
used for the synthesis of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. TiO2 nanoparticles were
synthesized via simultaneous oxidation/hydrolysis of TiCl4 . Kinetics and
thermodynamics studies give new insight into TiCl4 reaction mechanisms. Effects
of different H2O/O2 ratios were studied theoretically and experimentally.
Simultaneous TiCl4 oxidation/hydrolysis results in higher crystallinity and
purity. Crystalline anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized in the gas phase
using an H2O-assisted atmospheric-pressure CVS process. Simultaneous
oxidation/hydrolysis of TiCl4 in the H2O-assisted APCVS process demonstrates the
feasibility of facile fabrication and the designed synthesis of TiO2
nanoparticles in atmospheric pressure. Kinetics and thermodynamics studies of
TiCl4 reactions in the gas phase illustrated oxidation or hydrolysis domination
theoretically and were confirmed by experimental runs. Effects of H2O/O2 ratio
on the reactions mechanisms, phase formation, size characteristics, morphology,
and purity of TiO2 nanoparticles were experimentally studied using various
analytical techniques including TEM, XRD, SAED, and TG-DTA. The synthesized
particles were significantly finer with higher crystallinity than those produced
by the solitary oxidation process. The average size of TiO2 nanoparticles was 12
4 nm under simultaneous oxidation/hydrolysis, while that was 34 5 nm without
hydrolysis. Hydrolysis dominates in lower temperatures caused by lower
activation energy and higher kinetics of hydrolysis reaction.

Accelerated exploration of TRIP metallic glass composite by laser additive
manufacturing. A high-throughput strategy was proposed to accelerate the
exploration of. The distribution uniformity of B2CuZr phase was quantitatively
analysis. High-throughput results are in good agreement with discrete casting
investigations. Introducing transformation-induced plasticity TRIP effect into
bulk metallic glass compositesis an effective route to improve their ductility
and strain-hardening ability. Since the morphology and structure of the
crystalline austenite phases responsible for the TRIP phenomenon are strongly
dependent on the alloy composition and cooling rate during freezing,
distinguishing the optimal cases from a vast variety of candidates is the
primary task of exploring TRIP However, without a suitable theoretical guidance,
the exploration ofis usually performed via the traditional trial-and-error
route, making the BMGC development extremely time consuming and labor intensive.
Here, we present a novel high-throughput strategy to accelerate the exploration
process of TRIP The efficiency of this strategy was demonstrated on a well-
studied CuZrAl alloy system. A screening library, comprised by 121 cylindrical
samples with different conditions, was rapidly prepared by laser additive
manufacturing LAM. The phases of the library were efficiently identified by
micro-area X-ray diffraction M-XRD to screen the optimal compositions and
cooling rates that precipitate only B2CuZr phase. The distribution uniformity of
the B2CuZr phase was further evaluated based on digital image processing
technology to screen the candidates of better ductility. The high-throughput
results are in good agreement with the previous casting investigations of
discrete samples, confirming the validity of the present high-throughput
strategy.

Research on Electric Discharge Shock Crush Method Using Thin Wire. Recently,
construction methods using gunpowder have been widely used to crush bedrock,
concrete, etc. However, when these methods are used in urban areas, there can be
negative safety and environmental effects. Therefore, there has been a growing
demand for electric discharge shock crush, which is a static, non-blasting crush
method that does not use gunpowder. This research aims to develop a method of
controlling the crack direction during electric discharge shock crush. For the
experiment, we used test pieces with a water-cement ratio of 55%, a height of
200 mm, and a diameter of 100 mm. Then, we created four types of wedge shape to
use on the test pieces, including a two-way wedge shape, a three-way wedge shape
a downward wedge is added, a lateral disc wedge shape, and a four-way wedge
shape decahedron. For the discharge characteristics, the current and voltage
waveforms had little difference between the test pieces, and it was confirmed
that a larger waveform resulted from an increase in the charging voltage. Also,
the two-way wedge shape could not control the crack direction. However, the
three-way wedge shape could control a crack in the vertical direction and divide
the test piece into two pieces. Thus, it is important to have a downward wedge
three-way wedge to control the crack in the vertical direction. In addition, the
lateral disc wedge shape generates a crack in the horizontal direction, and as a
result, the test piece was sliced horizontally like a disc. Also, the four-way
wedge shape cracked the test piece in the vertical and horizontal directions
along the edges of the wedge. In conclusion, it was found that the wedge shape
controls the crack directions.

Assembling flower-on-sheet CoPNiCoP nanohybrids as efficient self-supported
electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction in both acidic and alkaline
media. Self-supported electrocatalysts are directly employed as electrodes for
water splitting. Herein, we report an effective strategy to develop flower-on-
sheet structured nanohybrids, where CoP nanoflowersare epitaxially grown along
the edges of NiCoP nanosheets namely NiCoP on carbon cloth m-CoPNiCoP/CC, thus
obtained as efficient self-supported electrodes for the hydrogen evolution
reaction HER in both acidic and alkaline media. This unique nanostructure endows
NiCoP nanosheets with maximal exposed surface area, along with increased active
sites brought by CoP nanoflowers. Moreover, due to good electrical connection
between CoP nanoflowers and NiCoP, and between conductive NiCoP and carbon
cloth, electrons can easily transfer from active sites to the conductive
substrates. Therefore, the m-CoPNiCoP/CC exhibits superior catalytic activity
and stability for HER in both acidic and alkaline media. The as-prepared
electrocatalyst requires overpotentials of only 75.081.5mV to deliver a
benchmark current density of 10mAcm2 in acidic and alkaline media, respectively,
which are superior to most of the previously reported metal phosphides-based
electrocatalysts. Hence, this work can provide a design for developing highly
active electrocatalysts for water splitting. The self-supported CoPNiCoP
nanohybrids were prepared as efficient and durable electrocatalysts for hydrogen
evolution reaction in both acidic and alkaline media, where CoP nanoflowers are
epitaxially grown along the edges of NiCoP nanosheets.

Coupling effects of tungsten and molybdenum on microstructure and stress-rupture
properties of a nickel-base cast superalloy. In order to comprehensively
understand the forming mechanism of abnormal phases solidified in a nickel-base
cast superalloy with additives of tungsten and molybdenum, the coupling effects
of W and Mo on the microstructure and stress-rupture properties were
investigated in this paper. The results indicated that the precipitation of
primary -W, Mo phase depended tremendously on the amount of W and Mo addition.
When the total amount of W and Mo was greater than 5.79at%, -W, Mo phase became
easily precipitated in the alloy. With increasing of Mo/W ratio, the dendrite-
like -W, Mo phases were apt to convert into small bars or blocky-like phases at
the vicinities of / eutectic. The morphological changes of -W, Mo phase can be
interpreted as the non-equilibrium solidification of W and Mo in the alloy.
Since the large sized -W, Mo phase has detrimental effects on stress-rupture
properties in as-cast conditions, secondary cracks may mainly initiate at and
then propagate along the interfaces of brittle phases and soft matrix. During
exposing at 1100 for 1000h, the -W, Mo phases transformed gradually into bigger
and harder M6C carbide, which results in decreasing of stress-rupture properties
of the alloy. Finally, the alloy with an addition of 14W-1Mowt% maintained the
longest stress lives at high temperatures and therefore it revealed the best
microstructure stability after 1100/1000/h thermal exposure.

Deposition of calcium phosphate coatings using condensed phosphates P2O74 and
P3O105 as phosphate source through induction heating. In present work condensed
phosphates P2O74- and P3O105- were used as phosphate source in induction heating
to deposit calcium phosphate coatings. The phase, morphology, and composition of
different phosphate-related coatings were characterized and compared using XRD,
FTIR, and SEM analyses. Results showed that P2O74-formed calcium pyrophosphate
hydrate coatings with interconnected cuboid-like particles. The as-deposited
calcium tripolyphosphate hydrate coating with P3O105- was mainly composed of
flower-like particles assembled by plate-like crystals. The bioactivity and
cytocompatibility of the coatings were also studied. Moreover, the feasibility
of using hybrid phosphate sources for preparing and depositing coatings onto

A biocompatible bacterial cellulose/tannic acid composite with antibacterial and
anti-biofilm activities for biomedical applications. Biofilm-associated
infections are in a high rate of recurrence and biofilms show formidable
resistance to current antibiotics, making them a growing challenge in biomedical
field. In this study, a biocompatible composite was developed by incorporating
tannic acid TA and MgCl2 to bacterial cellulose BC for antimicrobial and anti-
biofilm purposes. The morphology was investigated by scanning electron
microscopy SEM, and chemical structure were characterized by Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectra XPS. In vitro release
profiles of tannic acid revealed that the Mg2+ cross-links help impede the
release of TA from BC matrix, while composite BC-TA lacked Mg2+ ionic cross-
links, thus more TA was released from the hydrogel. The BC-TA-Mg composites also
displayed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli and P.
aeruginosa. Moreover, the composites significantly reduced biofilm formation of
S. aureus and P. aeruginosa after 24 h incubation by 80% and 87%, respectively.a
consequence, the BC-TA-Mg composites are a very promising material for combating
biofilm-associated infections in biomedical and public health fields.

Efficient antimicrobial silk composites using synergistic effects of violacein
and silver nanoparticles. Violacein, a natural violet biopigment with efficient
bioactivities from Gram-negative bacteria, possesses good affinity to silk fiber
and complexes with silver. In this paper, a new approach involving the surface
modification of silk fabrics with violacein for the in-situ synthesis of silver
nanoparticleswas developed. Violacein is used to modify silk material.
Subsequently, silk containing bio-violacein was in situ assembled by silver ions
and formed Functional silk composites FSC containing bio-violacein andwere
obtained with effective synergistic antimicrobial effects. FSC were
characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, and
scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray

0.16 g/g, respectively.were small particles with irregular shapes and sizes
<60-70 nm. Antimicrobial activities of the FSC were evaluated against S. aureus,
E. coli, and C. albicans. The silk fabric with violacein possessed good
antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, with a bacterial reduction of 81.25%.
FSC with violacein combined withintegration exhibited good synergistic
properties as excellent antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, E. coli, and
C. albicans, with microbial reductions of 99.98%, 99.90%, and 99.85%,

Development of an Oxidation Resistant Coating on NbBased Ultra-High Temperature
Alloy. A coating with a duplex layer structure, outer -NiAl and inner -ReCrNi
layers, was formed on the third generation Nb-5Mo-15W-16Si- 5Hf-5C alloy by
using successively Re-pack cementation, electroplating of ReNi film, and Cr/Al
pack cementation. The duplex layer coating changed during high temperature
oxidation to form a coating with a four layer structure: an outermost Ni2Al3, an
outer Ni, an inner -ReCrNi, and an innermost -ReNb. The Re-pack cementation was
carried in an alumina crucible where the specimen was buried in Re metal powder,
in vacuum at to form a Re film, and then a ReNi film was electroplated onto the
Re-pack treated alloy. The coated alloy formed a protective -Al2O3 scale when
oxidized at in air for 14.4ks. It was concluded that the -ReCrNi phase can act
as a diffusion-barrier against both inward Al diffusion and outward diffusion of
alloying elements from the alloy substrate to the -NiAl.

Influence of Steel Fiber on Durability Performance of Concrete under Freeze-Thaw
Cycles. To verify the steel fiber effect on durability properties of the
concrete in cold regions, four types of steel fiber reinforced concrete were
prepared, and the fiber dosage were 0, 20 kg, 40 kg, and 60 kg, respectively.
The rapid freeze-thaw test was adopted to evaluate the frost resistance
durability, and the evaluation indexes of the mass loss and the residual dynamic
modulus of elasticity RDME the samples were compared, respectively. The frost
damage of the matrix regarding the different freeze-thaw cycleswas evaluated
using the Weibull distribution. The capillary water absorption CWA experiments
were also conducted corresponding to different freeze-thaw cycles The results
revealed that the mass loss was not an effective index for frost damage
evaluation of macro-steel fiber reinforced concrete. Thecorresponding to the
loss of RDME to 60% were enhanced noticeably with the increase of fiber content.
The relationship between the frost damage and thecan be evaluated using the
Weibull distribution. Compared with the PC, the frost resistance grade of the
reinforced concrete with fiber dosage of 60 kg/m3 increased by 125%. After the
frost action, the CWA capacity of concrete improved significantly, while, under
the same the CWA of the matrix decreased with the increment of macro-steel fiber
dosage. The steel fiber showed a strong positive influence on enhancing the
durability performance of concrete in cold region.

Capacitive coupled non-zero IV and type-II memristive properties of the
NiFe2O4TiO2 nanocomposite. In the present work, we have demonstrated the
capacitive coupled non-zero and type-II hysteresis behavior of nickel ferrite
NFO-titanium oxide TiO2 nanocomposite. For this, NFO nanoparticlesand TiO2were
synthesized using hydrothermal and sol-gel method, respectively. The NFOTiO2
nanocomposite was prepared using a solid-state reaction method and characterized
by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission
scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrical results of the NFOTiO2 memory device
have shown non-zero IV unable to cross at origin, cross-over IV and type-II
hysteresis tangential hysteresis loops properties and their occurrence was
depended upon the magnitude of the electrical stimulus. To further clarify the
dominance of the memristive and type-II properties, we have calculated the
charge-flux and non-transversal di/dvt characteristics of the device based on
experimental results. The charge transport mechanisms were investigated and a
plausible resistive switching mechanism was reported. Our investigations provide
some insights to explain the non-zero and type-II hysteresis behavior of the

Preparation of Persimmon Tannins Immobilized on Collagen Adsorbent and Research
on its Adsorption to Cr6+. Persimmon tannins PT were immobilized on a matrix of
collagen fiber by cross-linking of glutaraldehyde. The adsorption behaviours to
Cr6+ on PT were investigated including the effects of initial pH, initial
concentration of Cr6+ , temperature, adsorbent dosage, adsorption kinetics and
the recycling performance of PT adsorbents. The results showed that pH value had
a major influence in adsorption. PT showed a strong adsorbability to Cr6+ in the
pH range of 1.0 to 3.0, whereas the effect of temperature on the adsorption was
comparatively weaker. The adsorption equilibrium could be well described by
Freundlich equation. PT adsorption efficiency of Cr6+ reached 98.04% and the
maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity of Cr6+ was up to 49.01 mg/g at with a
pH value of 2.0, 100 mg/L of initial concentration of Cr6+ and 0.1g of adsorbent
dosage. The adsorption data could be well fitted by pseudo-second-order rate
model. PT adsorbents were characterized by FTIR and EDS. The analysis indicated
that the adsorption mechanism was mainly contributed by redox adsorption.

study on growth mechanism and crystalline structure of zinc blende ZB/wurtzite
WZ polytypic InAs nanostrutures grown on Si-substrate using x-ray diffraction,

structure exhibits disorder due to twin defect/stacking fault formation at the
homointerfaces of ZB/WZ segments in the polytypic crystalline structure, which
is related to the ZB:WZ phase ratio. The average ratio of ZB and WZ crystal

Experimental Research and Sensitivity Analysis of Mudstone Similar Materials
Based on Orthogonal Design. Due to the strong hydration sensitivity of mudstone,
drilling of deep mudstone is difficult and pricy, which results in the study on
its physical and mechanical properties inseparable from similar material tests.
On these bases, triaxial compression and Brazilian tensile tests of the original
mudstone drilled from the caprock of the D5 aquifer structure are carried out.
Then, orthogonal experiments of mudstone similar materials with river sand and
barite powder as aggregate and cement and gypsum as the binder are conducted,
which include 3 factors that, respectively, are mass ratio of aggregate to
binder, mass ratio of cement to gypsum, and barite powder content, and each
factor contains 5 levels, totalling 25 groups of 150 samples. By comparing the
results of mudstone and artificial samples made of similar materials, it is
obvious that artificial samples and mudstone are significantly similar in terms
of density, compressive strength, elastic modulus, and compressive strength when
the aggregate-binder ratio is about 4, 8, 5, and 4, respectively. Further
sensitivity analysis showed that the aggregate-binder ratio played a major role
in controlling the properties of artificial samples, while the sensitivity of
different parameters to the cement-gypsum ratio and barite content was
different. The results indicate that the selected raw materials and their
proportion are feasible, which can meet similar requirements and can be a
reference for similar material experimental research of target mudstone.

possibility of chemical processes occurring in the material leading to its
expansion has been studied. The coefficient of expansion of the material when
heated is practically established. It has been established that the material can
swell, both under the influence of flame and when the temperature rises at a low
speed. Swelling coefficient at the same time it reaches 8. The temperature range
of swelling is 150250 , which is confirmed by thermodynamic calculations and
experimentally. The temperature at which the material begins to swell is lower

Corrosion and biocompatibility examination of multi-element modified calcium
phosphate bioceramic layers. Multi-ions doped bioactive calcium phosphate dCaP
layers were developed by pulse current deposition onto surgical grade titanium
alloy material Ti6Al4V. The coatings were electrodeposited from base electrolyte
containing adequate amounts of calcium nitrate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate
at. After electrodeposition, the pure CaP layers were doped with different ions
that possess bioactive and antimicrobial properties, such as Zn2+, Mg2+, Sr2+
and Ag+ ions. The morphology and structure of coatings were characterized by
Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM, Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM, Energy-
dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy EDX as well as XRD and FT-IR measurements. The
results revealed the pulse current deposited and surface post-treated CaP layer
to be mainly in hydroxyapatite phase. The corrosion properties of bioceramic
coatings were assessed in conventional simulated body fluid SBF in a three
electrode open cell by using potentiodynamic polarization measurements over two
weeks period. The electrochemical results revealed that the pure calcium
phosphate CaP coated implant material and the bare implant possess the highest
resistivity to corrosion, while the modified calcium phosphate coating showed
lower corrosion resistance by at least one order of magnitude. The cell
viability measurements showed that the electrochemically deposited CaP layer was

Evaluation of Multiaxial Low-Cycle Fatigue Failure Based on New Criterion and
its Application to High Temperature Structural Design.. In order to establish a
multiaxial low cycle fatigue criterion which can evaluate the fatigue life of
high temperature components, biaxial low cycle fatigue tests of 304 stainless
steel have been carried out with the cruciform specimens at under proportional
and nonproportional loading conditions. A multiaxial low cycle fatigue criterion
and its application to fatigue damage evaluation in design have been discussed
based on the present test results and the previous results which were produced
by tension-compression and torsion tests at elevated temperatures with the
tubular specimens.Configuration of iso-fatigue life contours of the Case B
loading on the -plane in which the maximum shear planes are on planes inclined
45 from the surface was different from that of the Case A loading in which they
are on planes 90 from the surface, because of difference in fracture mechanism.
The influence of normal strain in the maximum shear plane, en, on fatigue life
was not observed in the Case B loading, while the fatigue life was strongly
affected by en in the Case A loading. From iso-fatigue contours on the -plane,
the equivalent shear strain range, for the Case B loading was newly defined. It
was confirmed that the biaxial fatigue life data of proportional and
nonproportional loadings could be correlated well with and a fatigue damage
evaluation procedure by applying in design was proposed.

Flow stress of an aluminium alloy in the warm working range. The effect of
temperature and processing history on the flow stress of a two-phase aluminium
Al-6% Cu alloy was investigated. The flow stress was determined from the changes
in dimensions of flat, ring-shaped specimens using Avitzurs upper bound theorem.
The results indicate that the flow stress increases with the degree of
deformation irrespective of the specimen history considered and this tendency is
in general more pronounced at large deformations. The flow stress of this alloy
at large deformation is considerably lower at than at the lower temperatures
tested. The morphology and distribution of the second phase particles of this

Biocomposites based on hydroxyapatite matrix reinforced with nanostructured
monticellite CaMgSiO4 for biomedical application: Synthesis, characterization,
and biological studies. In this study, a simple and facile strategy was
developed for the synthesis of novel hydroxyapatite HA/nanostructured
monticellite ceramic composites by mechanical method. X-ray diffraction XRD,
scanning electron microscopy SEM, and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy EDS
were used to peruse the phase structure, and morphology of soaked ceramic
composites in simulated body fluid SBF. The in vitro bioactivity of HA-based
ceramic composites with nanostructured monticellite ranging from 0 to 50 wt% was
evaluated via investigating the formation ability of bone-like calcium
phosphates in SBF and the effect of obtained extracts from composites
dissolution on osteoblast-like G-292 cell line. Moreover, In vitro
cytocompatibility of the HA/monticellite ceramic composites was investigated by
MTT, cell growth & adhesion and alkaline phosphatase ALP activity assays, and
quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The results showed that HA/nanostructured
monticellite ceramic composites could induce apatite formation in SBF. The cell
proliferation and growth exposed to ceramic composites extracts were
significantly stimulated and promoted at a certain concentration range compared
to control for various time periods of cell culture. The optimized composite
extract enhanced considerably gene expression of G-292 type X collagen COLX at
different days. Also, G-292 cells were spread and adhered well on the ceramic
composite disc. Furthermore, ALP activity of G-292 cells exposed to ceramic
composites extracts was dramatically enhanced in comparison with pure HA extract
as control at different concentrations for various time periods of cell culture.
The results suggest that the optimized HA/nanostructured monticellite composite
is promising biomaterial for clinical applications such as orthopedic and
dentistry.

Study of Phonons in Semiconductor Superlattices by Raman Scattering Spectroscopy
and Microscopic Model Calculation. Raman spectroscopy is used to study phonons
in a series of thin AlAsm/GaAsn superlatticesgrown by molecular beam epitaxy
MBE. The influence of buffer layer type on the interface roughness of
heterostructures is carefully evaluated. The accuracy of optical phonons and the
degree of peak sharpness of GaAs-like confined modes are examined via off-
resonance Raman spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations of phonons in thin
AlAsm/GaAsn superlattices i.e. samples with m, n 12 are reported for various
directions of propagation by using a rigid-ion model. Optical phonons acquire
significant dispersive character when the wavevector q forming an angle with the
growth axis of the superlattice is changed from = 0 to /2,e. from 001 to 100.
The frequency gaps in the angular dispersions due to mode anti-crossing behavior
observed recently by Zunke et al. using micro-Raman spectroscopy and studied by
a continuum model are found to be in reasonably good agreement with our lattice
dynamical model calculations.

Performance Characteristic of Cold Recycled Mixture with Asphalt Emulsion and
Chemical Additives. Three types of chemical additives were used to modify
asphalt emulsion recycled mixture. These chemical additives include composite
Portland cement CPC, hydrated lime HL, and a combination of hydrated lime and
ground-granulated blast-furnace slag GGBF. The influence of different additives
on the recycled mixture performance was investigated by volumetric and strength
tests, moisture susceptibility test, rutting resistance test, and low
temperature bending test. To better understand its performance characteristic,
the microstructure images of the recycled mixture were observed by environmental
scanning electron microscope ESEM. Test results demonstrate that the performance
improvement of the emulsion recycled mixture depends on the types and content of
chemical additives. Several recommendations are presented for the selection of
chemical materials. Based on ESEM image analysis, the interface bonding
mechanism is proposed to explain the performance characteristic of the recycled
mixture with asphalt emulsion and cementitious materials.

Influence of Annealing on the Al2O3/4HSiCInterface. Summarizing, after a post-
deposition annealing at, correlation of XPS, SIMS and HRTEM data yields a
scenario where the SiO x layer, occurring after ozone cleaning and Al2O3
deposition, breaks up and transforms into islands of SiO2 , which is
thermodynamically very stable, at the interface.a result, a rather rough
interface region evolves and excess of pure Si appears in the Al2O3 film.
Moreover, a pronounced accumulation of H takes place in the rough interface
region and this may at least partly be responsible for the low density of
shallow electron states reported for annealed Al2O3 /4HSiC structures.

Fabrication of Photothermal Film for Deicing Process Based on Gold Nano-
Aggregate Encapsulated Yolk-Shell Structure. Ice accumulation on vessels,
airplanes, or on the off-shore plants surfaces causes major accidents and
difficulties in operation. Therefore, highly efficient and environmentally
friendly materials for use as deicing surfaces are in continuous demand.
Accordingly, photothermal materials have gained enormous attention owing to
their outstanding performance in the removal of ice. Herein, a gold nano-
aggregate yolk-shell structure GNA-YS was introduced as a deicing material. GNA-
YS was homogeneously dispersed in photocurable polyurethane acrylate and used to
fabricate a highly efficient and sunlight-responsive GNA-YS film. Upon
irradiation with an 810 nm light-emitting diode LED 135 mW cm 2 , the
temperature of the GNA-YS film increased by approximately within 2 min, which
rapidly within 6 min melted the accumulated ice. Moreover, the GNA-YS film
exhibited a temperature increase of in a refrigerator under LED illumination for
1 min. Additionally excellent stability was confirmed through repeated
experiments. The newly developed deicing GNA-YS film has prospective
applicability in vessels or airplanes.

Si/SiO2nanocomposite by CVD infiltration of porous SiO2. The aim of the present
paper is to report first results on an innovative method for producing Si/SiO2
nano-composites. Starting from a porous oxide structure, we infiltrated Si by
Chemical Vapour Deposition of SiH4 , under controlled conditions. In this way,
we succeeded in infiltrating Si into the SiO2 template. Porous oxide is obtained
by dry oxidation of mesoporous Si. By means of the electrochemical process used
for producing porous Si, an interconnected pore structure is obtained. This
allows for Si infiltration, giving rise, in principle, to an interconnected
network of Si crystallites, in which electrical carriers are easily driven.
Efficient charge injection in Si nanocrystals is of crucial importance for
several applications, from electroluminescence to memory devices.

Analysis of vaporization kinetics of group-III nitrides. On the basis of
experimental data on Knudsen and Langmuir evaporation of group-III nitrides, the
role of surface kinetics is analyzed. Different behavior of nitrides compared
with other IIIV compounds is assumed to originate from the existence of a
significant kinetic barrier for adsorption/desorption of molecular nitrogen.
Thermodynamic properties of GaN, AlN and InN are refined and
evaporation/condensation coefficients of these compounds are obtained as
functions of temperature. The trends in nitrides vaporization are analyzed using
a model accounting for the kinetics of the evaporation process. The theoretical
predictions are compared with those available in the literature experimental
data.

In vitro characterization of hydroxyapatite and cobalt ferrite nanoparticles
compounds and their biocompatibility in vivo. Bioactive materials in combination
with antibiotics have been widely developed for the treatment of bone infection.
Thus, this work aims to characterize six biomaterials formulated with different
concentrations of hydroxyapatite and cobalt ferrite nanoparticles, in addition
to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, using X-ray diffraction XRD, scanning electron
microscopy SEM, and the antibiotic diffusion test on agar. Furthermore, in vivo
biocompatibility and the reabsorption process of these materials were analyzed.
XRD showed that both hydroxyapatite and cobalt ferrite present high
crystallinity. The photomicrographs obtained by SEM revealed that composites
have a complex surface, evidenced by the irregular arrangement of the
hydroxyapatite and cobalt ferrite granules, besides demonstrating the
interaction between their components. The antibiotic-diffusion test showed that
all biomaterials produced an inhibition halo in Staphylococcus aureus cultures.
For the biocompatibility study, composites were surgically implanted in the
dorsal region of rabbits. At15 , 30, 70, and 100 days, biopsies of the implanted
regions were performed. The biomaterials were easily identified during
histological analysis and no significant inflammatory process, nor histological
signs of toxicity or rejection by the adjacent tissue were observed. We can
conclude that the biomaterials analyzed are biocompatible, degradable, and
effective in inhibiting the in vitro growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Graphical

dynamic milling force and the surface morphology characteristic curve cross-
correlation function absolute value can reach 0.952 when the tool path and
splice joints into 90.And the cross-correlation function absolute value of
milling force and the surface morphology characteristic is larger than vibration
signal one. When the tool path and the joint Angle is small, the milling force
influence on the surface morphology is lesser, so process should try to choose
the smaller Angle seam.

FEA Modelling of the Combined Hard TurningRolling Process Used at Bearing Rings.
In general, the production of bearings is a very large series production, which
is why in production the technological lines are designed to process a single
size of bearings. Changing the production line for different types of bearings
is expensive and time consuming, especially where grinding and honing processes
are required. An alternative to these abrasive processes is hard turning. The
literature indicates that due to highprecision machines, the accuracy of hard-
turned parts is comparable to grinding processes. It is also indicated that the
integrity of the surface and the topography of the surface together with the
residual induced stresses are parameters of interest and that influence the
performance of the bearings. So one method of increasing the durability of the
bearings is to ensure a low roughness of the elements and high residual induced
stresses. Deep rolling is considered as an alternative to honing and
rectification processes. Rolling can induce higher surface stresses in the
material compared to honing and grinding. The present paper proposes a combined
cutting tool made of a hard turning head and a rolling cutting tool for
machining bearing rings. A simulation of this combined process is performed with
the help of the finite element and thus the internal stress field, the
temperature fieldand the topography of the processed surface aredetermined.

Comparison of SIA defect morphologies from different interatomic potentials for
collision cascades in W. The morphology of defects formed in collision cascades
is an essential aspect of the subsequent evolution of the microstructure. The
morphological composition of a defect decides its stability, interaction, and
migration properties. We compare the defect morphologies in the primary
radiation damage caused by high energy collision cascades simulated using three
different interatomic potentials in W. An automated method to identify
morphologies of defects is used. While most defects form 1/2/\3 dislocation
loops, other specific morphologies include \1 dislocation loops, multiple loops
clustered together, rings corresponding to C15 configuration and its constituent
structures, and a combination of rings and dislocations. The analysis quantifies
the distribution of defects among different morphologies and the size
distribution of each morphology. We show that the disagreement between
predictions of the different potentials regarding defect morphology is much
stronger than the differences in predicted defect numbers.

Metal-induced growth of crystal Si for low-cost Al:ZnO/Si heterojunction thin
film photodetectors. Quality crystal silicon Si thin films were grown via the
metal-induced growth MIG method, which is a low-cost and metal-silicide assisted
technique. The metal catalysts of Ni, Pd and Co were first deposited onto
substrates for silicide template layer formation. Then, crystal Si thin films
with a thickness of ~ 5m were epitaxially deposited on the silicide seeds via DC
magnetron sputtering. The crystallinity of the Si films was confirmed and
investigated by X-ray diffraction XRD. These Si thin films were then used to
fabricate Al doped ZnO AZO/MIG Si heterojunction photodetectors. The device
achieved a saturation photocurrent of 23.2mA/cm2 at 5 V. This photocurrent level
is comparable with that of previous reported AZO/bulk-Si devices. Current
transport mechanisms and defect distributions were also studied. By analyzing
the dark current-voltage IV characteristics, the space charge limited SCL
current dominated junction behaviors with an exponential defect level
distribution were determined. In the bias range of 0.25V3 . For 0

An acoustic emission study of plastic deformation in polycrystalline aluminium.
Acoustic emission experiments were performed on polycrystalline and single
crystal 99.99% aluminium while undergoing tensile deformation. It was found that
acoustic emission counts as a function of grain size showed a maximum value at a
particular grain size. Furthermore, the slip area associated with this
particular grain size corresponded to the threshold level of detectability of
single dislocation slip events. The rate of decline in acoustic emission
activity as grain size is increased beyond the peak value suggests that grain
boundary associated dislocation sources are giving rise to the bulk of the
detected acoustic emissions.

Effect of internal gettering of iron on electrical characteristics of devices.
Different types of gettering treatments were applied to a real device process to
evaluate their ability to remove iron contamination from the device layer and
improve the electrical characteristics of the devices. NMOS and PMOS transistors
and other test structures were manufactured on boron doped, both iron
contaminated and uncontaminated Cz silicon wafers with or without gettering
treatment. Gettering treatments, which were designed to induce sufficient iron
precipitate nucleation in the bulk to ensure iron precipitation, were inserted
in the fabrication process after the last high temperature treatment in which
the iron solubility was higher than the contamination level. The electrical
characteristics of the devices, such as leakage currents, were measured. The
applied gettering treatments were found to be inefficient to improve the device
performance, possibly due to stronger gettering to heavily doped, ion
implantation damaged device layer.

Evolution of Stress-Induced Surface Damage and Stress-Relaxation of

investigated by transmission electron microscopy TEM and X-ray photoelectron

N+ implantation with 50 keV has been conducted on these films. The selected area
electron diffraction SAED from as-deposited film shows amorphous TiSi. As-
deposited TiSi film exhibited high stability even for the heat treatment at for
3600s. N+ implantation induced the direct formation of nano crystalline of fcc-
TiNx within the TiSi film. The XPS depth profiling and chemical shift suggest
that the preferential nitriding of Ti accompanied with the segregation of SiNx
occurred during N-implantation.

Ceramic Foams Coated with Zeolite Crystals. Ceramic foams can be used as
filters, dust collectors, light weight components and catalyst carriers. They
can be produced by a variety of techniques. The performance of ceramic foams
will be strongly improved when their mechanical properties are improved. For
this reason, we produced ceramic foams both by a modified reaction bonded RB
replica technique and by gel casting. With both methods, reticulated foam
structures with enhanced mechanical strength were obtained. Zeolites are a
special type of materials that are characterized by high catalytic properties.
They can be brought on a structured carrier by dip and slurry coating.
Nevertheless, in situ coating has as main advantage that the support is used as
the base for nucleation. This results in the formation of a chemical bond
between the zeolite crystals and the support. The goal of this contribution is
twofold: at first we demonstrate how Al2O3 foams with improved mechanical
strength can be produced both by the modified RB-alumina replica technique and
by gel casting. Secondly, it is shown that these ceramic foams can be coated
with silicalite zeolite crystals by insitu crystallization from a precursor sol.
The two-layer material combinations have been characterized with FESEM, XRD, CT
computer assisted tomography, IA Image Analysis and by mechanical tests.

Cost-Effective Production of High-Property Titanium Alloy from Powder. Blended
Elemental Powder Metallurgy is a very attractive method for producing titanium
alloys, which can be formed near net shape and have freedom in composition
selection. However applications are still limited due to affordability. In this
paper, we will discuss a possible cost-effective route, combining vacuum
sintering, extrusion, and heat treatment, to produce titanium alloys with
similar or better mechanical properties than that of ingot metallurgy titanium
alloys. The as-processed material with an oxygen content of 0.34 0.005 wt.% was
subjected to heat treatments such as annealing plus ageing and + annealing
without ageing to attain a typical lamellar/Widmanstatten/basketweave type
structure with a large variation in terms of the microstructural features such
as grain size, colony size, inter-lamellar spacing, thickness of grain boundary
, and size of individual lamellar. From mechanical property data attained here,
it was apparent that annealing in high - region gave a much better combination
of mechanical properties: yield strength 860-902 MPa, ultimate tensile strength
1060-1084 MPa and ductility/plastic strain 11.5-13.6%. The hardness values of
heat treated material varied betweenVickers hardness 36.8-44.5 Rockwell

Mechanical properties of l-lysine based segmented polyurethane vascular grafts
and their shape memory potential. Segmented polyurethanes based on
polycaprolactone, 4,4 metylene-bis-cyclohexyl isocyanate, and l-lysine were
synthesized, manufactured as small vascular grafts and characterized according
to ISO7198 standard for cardiovascular implants-tubular vascular prosthesis. In
terms of mechanical properties, the newly synthesized polyurethane films
exhibited lower secant modulus than Tecoflex SG 80A, a well-known medical grade
polyurethane. Similarly, when tested as grafts, the l-lysine-based polyurethane
exhibited lower longitudinal failure load 11.5 N vs. 116 N, lower
circumferential failure load per unit length 5.67 N/mm vs. 14.0 N/mm and lower
suture forces for both nylon 13.3 N vs. 24.0 N and silk 14.0 N vs. 19.3 N when
compared to Tecoflex SG 80A grafts. l-Lysine-based graft exhibited a burst
strength of 3620 mmHg 482.6 kPa and a compliance of 0.16%/mmHg. The cell
adhesion was demonstrated with NIH/3T3 fibroblasts where cell adhesion was
observed on both films and grafts, while cell alignment was observed only on the
grafts. The mechanical properties of this polyurethane and the possibility of
strain-induced PCL crystals as the switching phase for shape memory materials,
allowed a strain recovery ratio and a strain fixity ratio with values higher
than 95% and 90%, respectively, with a repeatability of the shape-memory
properties up to 4 thermo-mechanical cycles. Overall, the properties of lysine-
based polyurethanes are suitable for large diameter vascular grafts where cell
alignment can be controlled by their shape memory potential.

Numerical estimation of concrete beams reinforced with FRP bars. This paper

reinforced with Fibre Reinforced Polymer FRP bars, which can be competitive
alternative to steel bars for enhancing concrete structures. The objective of
this work is being identified as elaborating of reliable numerical model for
predicting strength capacity of structural elements with implementation of
Finite Element Analysis FEA. The numerical model is based on experimental study
prepared for the beams, which were reinforced with Basalt FRP BFRP bars and
steel bars for comparison. The results obtained for the beams reinforced with
steel bars are found to be in close agreement with the experimental results.
However, the beams reinforced with BFRP bars in experimental programme
demonstrated higher bearing capacity than those reinforced with steel bars,
which is not in a good convergence with numerical results. Authors did attempt
to describe the reasons on achieving experimentally higher bearing capacity of

Strengthening precipitates and mechanical performance of AlSiCuMg cast alloys
containing transition elements. This study investigated the active strengthening
precipitates existing in the structure of 354-type AlSiCuMg cast alloys
following the addition of Zr as a primary alloying element in addition to Ni and
Mn in different amounts and combinations. The investigation comprised three main
parts: the first part simulated the formation and dissolution of strengthening
precipitates and their precursors using differential scanning calorimetric DSC
heating analysis of as-quenched samples, the second part presented transmission
electron microscopy TEM observations of the fine precipitates existing in the
structure of the alloys studied, and the third part examined the mechanical
performance tensile properties and hardness values of the alloys studied.
Interpretation of the DSC heating data in accordance to the available literature
showed that the alloys are strengthened primarily by -Al2Cu and SAl2CuMg
precipitates and their precursors. Furthermore, some of the copper content was
consumed in forming AlNiCu particles instead of the -Al2Cu strengthening phase
and its precursors and hence the Ni-free alloys contain higher fractions of the
-Al2Cu phase and its precursors than the Ni-containing alloys. TEM
investigations confirmed the results obtained from the DSC heating analysis
regarding the combined strengthening effect of -Alu and SAluMg precipitates and
their precursors as well as the fraction of -Alu phase in Ni-free and Ni-
containing alloys. TEM observations revealed, also, that the alloys studied have
a secondary strengthening effect which is exerted by precipitates in the form of
Al x Zr,TiSi that formed following the addition of Zr. The Mechanical

Chemical interaction between carbon and titanium dissolved in liquid tin:
crystal structure and reactivity of Ti2SnC with Al. Chemical interaction between
carbon and titanium dissolved in liquid tin was studied at temperatures higher
than. The phase equilibria in the ternary system graphitetitaniumtin were
investigated by thermal analysis, metallography, X-ray diffraction and electron
microprobe analysis. The isothermal section at is proposed. At this temperature,
carbon can react to yield a binary phase, TiC, or a ternary phase, Ti2SnC. The
structure of Ti2SnC is proposed on the basis of powder diffraction X-ray data
space group: P63 /m.m.c.; hexagonal axes a =0.31626 nm, c =1.36789 nm. Some
experiments realized by immersion of T300 fibres in SnTi alloys show that the
chemical reaction leads to either a single layer of TiC or a double-layer,
TiCTi2SnC. The results demonstrate that the ternary phase is not stable in

Effect of H2S on performance of Pd4Pt alloy membranes. The effect of H2S on the
performance of a hydrogen separation membrane with the composition Pd4Pt was
evaluated at 350, 400 and. Exposure to hydrogen containing 1000 ppm H2S and
10%He resulted in two performance trends. At, a continuous decline in flux was
observed which was attributed to the growth of sulphide corrosion on the
membrane surface linked to surface contamination by stainless steel derived
particles. At400 and, the H2 flux decreased sharply followed by a slow recovery.
This trend was attributed to Pt enrichment of the surface resulting from
extraction of Pd through the formation of Pd4Pt. Also at 400 and, stainless
steel based particle contamination was found to modify and/or enhance the
corrosive effects of the H2S containing test gas. The implications of the
metallic and/or metal sulphide surface contaminant effects are significant in
that these contaminants could result in severe performance degradation and
ultimately even mechanical failure.

An atomistic study of self-accommodation martensite morphologies and
microstructure evolution during forward and reverse martensitic transformations
in single crystal and bicrystal NiTi alloys. Proposed an atomic tracing method
to identify specific numbers of B19 martensite variants. Revealed grain boundary
effect on self-accommodation morphology of martensite variants in
nanocrystalline NiTi alloy. Clarified formation and evolution of three
significant types of self-accommodation morphologies. The forward and reverse
martensitic transformations in NiTi alloys with different crystallography
conditions, in terms of 100-oriented and 110-oriented single crystal models as
well as a bicrystal model possessing twist grain boundary, are studied deeply
using molecular dynamics simulations. An atomic tracing method is proposed to
identify the specific numbers of B19 martensite variants, hence the self-
accommodation martensite morphologies and microstructure evolution during
cooling and heating are clearly demonstrated at the atomic scale. The triangular
self-accommodation morphology consisted of three correspondence
variantspossessing { 1 1 1 } M type I twin relationships is formed in the NiTi
single crystals at the beginning of the martensitic transformation, and stays
settled till the end of the transformation. Whereas three types of self-
accommodation morphologies including triangular, herring-bone and mixed
morphologies are formed in the bicrystal, due to the geometrical constraint
induced by the grain boundary. The mixed self-accommodation morphology is
unstable, which occurs briefly during martensitic transformation and thus
evolves into herring-bone morphology ultimately. During reverse transformation,
B2 austenite phase nucleates preferentially at the triple-junctions of the
triangular self-accommodation morphology in NiTi single crystals, and propagates
along the junction plane rather than the 001 M compound twin boundaries in the
bicrystal alloy.

A dislocation-based cyclic polycrystalline visco-plastic constitutive model for
ratchetting of metals with face-centered cubic crystal structure. In the
framework of crystal plasticity, a dislocation-based cyclic polycrystalline
visco-plastic constitutive model is proposed to describe the ratchetting of the
metals with a face-centered cubic FCC crystal structure. A new rate-dependent
flow rule considering the thermal activation energy of dislocation slipping is
developed, and a dislocation-based Armstrong-Frederick non-linear kinematic
hardening rule is introduced to provide a better prediction to the ratchetting.
The isotropic hardening associated with the short-ranged interactions of
dislocations is represented by the evolution of critical shear stress in each
slip system. Comparing the prediction with corresponding experimental results,
it is shown that the uniaxial and multiaxial ratchetting of polycrystalline 316L
stainless steel are reasonably described by the proposed model. The dependence
of the intra-granular ratchetting on the crystallographic orientation of grains
can be also reflected by the model.

Improved stability of superelasticity and elastocaloric effect in TiNi alloys by
suppressing Lders-like deformation under tensile load. Functional stability of
superelasticity is crucial for practical applications of shape memory alloys. It
is degraded by a Lders-like deformation with elevated local stress concentration
under tensile load. By increasing the degree of solute supersaturation and
applying appropriate thermomechanical treatments, a TiNi alloy with
nanocrystallinity and dispersed nanoprecipitates is obtained. In contrast to
conventional TiNi alloys, the superelasticity in the target alloy is accompanied
by homogeneous deformation due to the sluggish stress-induced martensitic
transformation. The alloy thus shows a fully recoverable strain of 6% under
tensile stress over 1 GPa and a large adiabatic temperature decrease of under a
strain of 4.5% at room temperature. Moreover, both superelasticity and
elastocaloric effect exhibit negligible degradation in response to applied
strain of 4% during cycling. We attribute the improved functional stability to
low dislocation activity resulting from the suppression of localized deformation
and the combined strengthening effect of nanoprecipitates and nanocrystalline
structure. Thus, the design of such a microstructure enabling homogeneous
deformation provides a recipe for stable superelasticity and elastocaloric
effect.

Sputter deposition of NiTi to investigate the Ti loss rate as a function of

Crystalline samples, which reveal a martensitic transformation, were fabricated
by magnetron sputtering and subsequent thermal treatment. A systematic
investigation to determine the deviation between target and substrate
composition was carried out by means of microprobe analysis. Typical loss rates
in sputtering targets with Ti content higher than 49.5at.% were in the order of
4.3at.%, whereas more Ni-rich targets revealed a Ti loss rate of only
0.51.5at.%. Sacrificial layer technique was applied to obtain free-standing NiTi

Micromechanical behaviour of Si-based particulate assemblies: A comparative
study using DEM and atomistic simulations. In this paper, we investigate the
micromechanical behaviour of Si-based particulate systems subjected to tri-axial
compression loading. The investigations are based on three-dimensional discrete
element modelling DEM and simulations. At first, we compare the variation of
mean compressive stress for a silicon assembly subjected to tri-axial
compression, predicted at two different scales: at the particulate scale, using
the DEM simulation mono-dispersed particulates and at the atomistic scale using
the molecular dynamics MD simulation results for silicon mono-crystal reported
by Mylvaganam and Zhang 2003 K. Mylvaganam, L. Zhang, Key Eng. Mater. 233236
2003 615620. Both the simulation methods considered the silicon assembly
subjected to an identical tri-axial loading condition. We observed a good
qualitative agreement between the DEM and MD simulation results for the mean
compressive stress when the assembly was subjected to small volumetric strain.
However, at large volumetric strain, the mean stress of the silicon assembly
predicted from MD simulation did not scale-up with the DEM results. This
discrepancy could be due to that MD simulation is only valid for particle
contacts, which are independent of one another and does not consider the
inherent discrete nature of particulates and the induced anisotropy prevailing
at particulate scale. The micromechanical behaviour of particulate assemblies
strongly depends on the inherent discrete nature of the particles, their single-
particle properties and the induced anisotropy during mechanical loading. At the
second stage, using DEM, we present the evolution of macroscopic compressive
stress and several micromechanical features for four cases of the commonly used
Si based poly-dispersed particulate assemblies Si, SiC,Si3N4 and SiO2 under tri-
axial compression loading. We also present the evolution of several other
phenomena occurring at particulate scale, such as the energy dissipation
characteristics due to sliding contacts and the features of fabric structures
developed during mechanical loading. The study shows that the single-particle
properties of the Si based assemblies considered here significantly affect the
micromechanical behaviour of the assemblies and DEM is a powerful tool to get
insights on the internal behaviour of discrete particulates under mechanical
loading.

Optimum Design and Performance of Porous Concrete for Heavy-Load Traffic
Pavement in Cold and Heavy Rainfall Region of NE China. The aim of the study was
to solve the problem of drainage stability of pavement base in cold and
Cloudburst area. With porous concrete as the research object, an optimum design
of porous concrete was determined using a step filling and orthogonal test
method, and the relationship between the porosity and the connected porosity of
the porous concrete was analyzed. Furthermore, drainage performance and frost
resistance of the pavement, compressive strength of the porous concrete, bending
strength, and compressive elastic modulus were studied. The results show that
the effects of water-cement ratio on the strength of porous concrete based on
the step filling method are the most significant. In addition, the connected
porosity and goal porosity have a good linear relationship; that is, the
drainage performance increases with the increase in connected porosity, whereas
the frost resistance, compressive strength, flexural tensile strength, and
compressive elastic modulus decrease with the increase in connected porosity.
Based on an engineering project in Inner Mongolia in China, it was shown that
porous concrete with a goal porosity of 15% used as a pavement base could meet
the requirements of cold weather, showers, and heavy traffic.

Selective oxidation of tool steel surfaces under a protective gas atmosphere
using inductive heat treatment. For the realization of liquid lubricant free
forming processes different approaches are conceivable. The priority program
1676 Dry forming - Sustainable production through dry machining in metal forming
addresses this issue in the context of metal forming processes. The present
study reports results from one subproject of the priority program that employs
selective oxidization of tool steel surfaces for the implementation of a dry
sheet metal deep drawing process. Within the present study, specimen surfaces of
the tool steel 1.2379 were heat-treated to optimize their tribological
properties with respect to sliding wear behaviour in contact with drawn sheet
metal DP600+Z. The heat treatment was designed to result in the formation of
selective oxide layers that can act as friction reducing separation layers. The
heating setup employed an inductive heating under protective gas atmosphere.
Selective oxidation was realized by controlling the residual oxygen content.
Specifically, the specimens were heated in the near-surface region just above
the annealing temperature, thus avoiding the degradation of mechanical
properties in the bulk. Evaluation of hardness along cross-sections of each
specimen revealed suitable initial temperatures for the inductive heat
treatment. Oxide layer systems were analyzed regarding their tribological
sliding wear behaviour after selective oxidation, as well as their morphology
and chemical composition before and after the sliding wear tests.

X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure Applied to Ferroelectrics. This chapter is
devoted to explaining the foundation and merits of the application of
synchrotron radiation for studying the X-ray absorption fine structure XAFS in
ferroelectric materials. XAFS in the local order allows the follows: determining
the oxidation states, interatomic distances, Debye-Waller factors and the
coordination number of atoms at the first few shells around the absorbing atom,
up to 0.5 nm. The text explains the features of the photoelectric effect, as
well as its relationship with the absorption edges of each element. Applying the
Fermis Golden Rule, it is explained that the fine structure of absorption edge
spectra is the result of the interference of the photoelectron single- and
multiple-scattering. This gives rise to the effects of X-ray Absorption Near
Edge Structure XANES and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure EXAFS. The
content includes significant effects for the study of ferroelectric materials in
XANES: energy shift of the edge position, pre-edge transitions and white-lines.
Subsequently, the experimental methods and EXAFS spectra processing, by both
empirical methods and theoretical models with multiple scattering paths, are
presented. Finally, we offer some works representing XAFS applied to
ferroelectrics, from the explanation of the displacive or order-disorder nature
of the materials PbTiO3 and BaTiO3, to those dedicated to relaxors and
Aurivillius oxides.

Microwrinkled pH-sensitive hydrogel films and their role on the cell
adhesion/proliferation. In this work, hydrogels based on HEMA and DMAEMA pH-
sensitive monomer were used to form biocompatible films which present
microwrinkled patterns in their surface, with the focus of exploring the role of
chemical composition on cell adhesion and proliferation. Three different pH 5.4,
7.4, and 8.3 were employed to prepare these hydrogels. The pre-polymerized
hydrogel mixtures were deposited via spin coating, then exposed to vacuum for
deswelling the films and finally, to UV-light to spontaneously generate the
wrinkled pattern. By following this procedure, is possible to form a thin rigid
layer on the top of the soft and incompletely polymerized hydrogel film which
generates, in turn, a wrinkled pattern due to strain mismatch in the interface.
FE-SEM and AFM micrographs allowed us to characterize the wrinkled pattern
dimensions. The results evidenced that chemical composition is directly related
to the surface pattern morphologies obtained, not so in the case of pH
variation, which does not generate relevant changes in the pattern morphology.
Interestingly, these pH variations resulted in significant alterations on the
interface-cell interactions. More precisely, a premyoblastic cell monolayer was
cultured over the wrinkled pattern, showing an optimal cell proliferation at
neutral pH. Also, the variation of DMAEMA amount on the monomer feed composition
employed for the preparation of the wrinkle surfaces revealed that a certain
amount is required to favor cell attachment and growth.

combustibility test of Oil Palm empty fruit bunch EFB-plastic composites to
determine their fire resistance. Specimens were of several composite types with
dimension of 40 x 40 x 50 mm 3 . Combustibility test was done according to JIS
Aby using small scale cylindrical furnace. Initial temperature of furnace was
set at. Based on JISA1321-1975, all the composites tested were classified into
combustible materials due to their temperature gradient higher than. The lowest
temperature gradient was attained at for PE-EFB/GF/GF short fibers composite.
However, the result showed that the temperature gradient of PE-EFB/GF/GF short
fibers composite was lower compared to some solid woods and commercial wood-
based panels. Weight loss has a strong relationships with density of the
composites, shown by polynomial equation y = -181.82 x 2 + 452.36 x - 205.5, R 2
= 0.9156. The density of composites which formed EFB layers tended to decrease,
conscequently increased their weight loss. Concerning the both factors, PE-
EFB/GF/GF short fibers composite was recommended as the best fire resistance
among the tested composites due to its lowest temperature gradient 75 oC and
relatively lower weight loss 64.17 %.

Processing soft ferromagnetic metallic glasses: on novel cooling strategies in
gas atomization, hydrogen enhancement, and consolidation. Processing soft
ferromagnetic glass-forming alloys through gas atomization and consolidation is
the most effective technique to produce bulk samples. The commercial viability
of these materials depends on commercial purity feedstock. However,
crystallization in commercial purity feedstock is several orders of magnitude
faster than in high purity materials. The production of amorphous powders with
commercial purity requires high cooling rates, which can only be achieved by
extending the common process window in conventional gas atomization. The
development of novel cooling strategies during molten metal gas atomization on
two model alloys {Fe0.6Co0.40.75B0.2Si0.05}96Nb4 and Fe76B10Si9P5 is reported.
Hydrogen inducement during liquid quenching significantly improved the glass-
forming ability and soft magnetic properties of {Fe0.6Co0.40.75B0.2Si0.05}96Nb4
powders. Spark plasma sintering experiments verified that amorphous rings could
be produced regardless of the cooling strategies used. While the saturation
magnetization was almost unaffected by consolidation, the coercivity increased
slightly and permeability decreased significantly. The magnetic properties of
the final bulk samples were independent of feedstock quality. The developed
cooling strategies provide a great opportunity for the commercialization of soft
ferromagnetic glass-forming alloys with commercial purity.

Detection of stress corrosion cracking in a simulated BWR environment by
combined electrochemical potential noise and direct current potential drop
measurements. Stress corrosion cracking SCC is one of the most important
degradation mechanisms in light water reactor structural materials. In situ
corrosion monitoring tools with the capability to detect SCC initiation in high
temperature water environments would be important to identify critical
conditions; the measurement of electrochemical noise EN could be such a tool.
Laboratory investigations have indicated that detection of SCC initiation in
austenitic stainless steel by EN measurements may be possible under simulated
boiling water reactor BWR conditions, but further tests with an independent
online SCC detection method were required to confirm these preliminary results.
Therefore, the reversed direct current potential drop and EN techniques were
simultaneously applied during SCC initiation tests in a simulated BWR
environment on AISI 304 stainless steel notched compact tension and round bar
specimens. It has been shown that early SCC detection by electrochemical
potential noise measurements is p...

Model for consolidation of Ti-6AI-4V/SiC fibre composite from plasma sprayed
monotape. A model has been developed for the consolidation of low pressure
plasma sprayed LPPS titanium alloy matrix/silicon carbide fibre composites.
Empirical constitutive equations were combined with an analytical model to
describe the deformation of the rough surface region. The same constitutive
equations were combined with alternately analytical and empirical yield criteria
to describe the deformation of the regions of closed porosity surrounding the
fibres. The two submodels were then combined with finite element analysis to
make predictions of relative density and grain size as functions of pressure,
temperature, and time, as well as predictions of the variations in porosity with
position and fibre spacing. Experiments to validate the model were carried out
using Archimedes' principle and both optical and scanning electron
metallography. Data were found to agree reasonably well with predicted values.

Numerical and Experimental Simulation of Mountain Bike Suspension Systems
Subject to Regular Impact Excitation. The aim of the work reported here was to
investigate the potential benefits of rear suspension systems for mountain bikes
and to develop numerical models that could be used in future to help with the
design of improved suspension configurations.the basis for a study of the effect
of rear suspensions, two bicycles were chosen: one with full suspension and one
with only front suspension hard tail. Apart from the rear suspension, all other
aspects of the bicycles were closely matched. In order to control the number of
variables, a special rolling road test rig was used. Eight subjects were asked
to ride each bicycle on the rig in random order. Measurements were taken of
pedal torque and speed, rear wheel speed, forward thrust at front axle and
vertical acceleration at the saddle and handlebars. Physiological measurements
were also taken, but these are reported elsewhere. A DADS model of the rolling
road rig, bicycle and rider was created and numerical simulations were
performed. The results of the numerical simulations compared well with the
experimental results. Unmeasured parameters predicted by the DADS model could
therefore be used with reasonable confidence to aid the understanding of the
suspension performance. Physiological results, mechanical measurements and
simulation results all indicate that the full suspension bicycle shows a
significant improvement in terms of comfort and energy expenditure when riding
over regular bumps. The good correlation between measurement and simulation
provides a tool that can be used in future for optimization of bicycle
suspension design.

The microstructural and thickness uniformity of zirconia coatings produced by
r.f. ion plating. An ion plating system, which utilizes r.f. substrate biasing,
was studied to determine the influence of source to substrate distance on the
microstructure and thickness uniformity of zirconia coatings. Coating thickness
measurements were used to evaluate parameters from equations which describe
uniformity in absolute and relative terms with distance from the vapour source.
The results show that microstructure and thickness uniformity are significantly
influenced by the ratio of the plasma bombardment intensity and coating material
arrival rate; energetic bombardment effects from the plasma become relatively
more prominent on substrate surfaces positioned remotely from the source.

Grain boundary contributions to deformation and solid-state flow in severe
plastic deformation. More than 40 years ago, Professor J.C.M. Li put forth the
concept of grain boundary ledges as sources for dislocations. Since then, there
have been numerous confirmations of grain boundary dislocation sources,
consistent with the fundamental features of interfaces, and we will demonstrate
these observations in deformed metals and alloys observed in the TEM after
specific levels of plastic strain. More recently, Professor Li has proposed a
new mechanism for severe plastic deformation, or superplastic flow beyond the
normal realm of plasticity which involves a so-called interfacial fluid that
allows for continuous, solid-state flow accommodating large plastic strains, and
even very high strain rates. Some interesting examples of severe plastic
deformation illustrating these issues, and the connectedness to the incipient
and normal plastic regime the stressstrain diagram will be presented by
examining high velocity and hypervelocity impact craters in polycrystalline
metals and alloys. These exhibit varying degrees of plastic strain and
associated microstructures evolving from dislocation emission and interaction,
and the actual plastic flow and jetting of solid-state material from the crater
rims, which are shown to be arrays of adiabatic shear bands composed of
dynamically recrystallized grains. The concept of an interfacial fluid will be
examined considering dense dislocation arrays in the grain boundary phase regime
utilizing the amorphous dislocation lattice concept also originated by Professor
Li several decades ago.

Atomistic study of the effect of crack tip ledges on the nucleation of
dislocations in silicon single crystals at elevated temperature. We model a
single crystal of silicon approaching dimensions of 20nm20nm10nm with up to
200,000 atoms based on the ReaxFF first principles based reactive force field,
applied here to examine the influence of crack tip heterogeneities on the
nucleation of dislocations from crack tips as the temperature is increased well
beyond. Our study aims at generating insight into mechanisms of the brittle-to-
ductile transition BDT observed in silicon, which is known to change the
behavior of silicon crystals from predominantly brittle at low temperatures to
ductile at higher temperatures, likely involving a competition between brittle
bond-breaking and emission of dislocations. We first examine the
crystallographic orientations most widely known to exhibit fracture, for example
failure on the {111} and {110} planes. We find that even at very high
temperatures considered here around, the material behaved in a completely
brittle manner for systems with cracks oriented in the {111} and {110} planes.
In contrast, when the crack plane is changed to the {100} orientation, the
formation of complete dislocation loops is observed. The results reported in our
paper is the first direct observation of dislocation loops in silicon driven by
an increase in the temperature, and extends earlier studies that were focused
solely on extremely thin quasi-two-dimensional models. We demonstrate here that
the formation of these loops can be linked to the geometrical ledges at the
crack tip with favorable orientations for slip on the {111} planes. The detailed
mechanisms leading to the nucleation of dislocations involve changes at the
crack tip with bond rotations and formation of ledges, and we find that the
emergence of dislocations causes the crack to arrest, but re-initiation takes
place and no conclusive nucleation of dislocations and complete arrest of the
crack is observed. The thickness effect is discussed together with other sources
for formation of ledges along the crack front. Our findings provide important
insight towards the development of models for the brittleductile-transition in
silicon and potentially other materials, and emphasize on the significance of
thickness effects in simulations of fracture in crystal slabs.

Observations of tensile fracture process in aluminum by using a scanning exo-
electron emission microscope.. In the present study, observations of fracture
process in aluminum were carried out by using a scanning exo-electron emission
microscope. The distribution of the intensity of exo-electron emission near the
notch root was also investigated.The intensity of exo-electron emission
increased gradually with an increase of tensile strain up to the strain at
muximum load. A significantly rapid increase in the intensity of exo-electron
emission was found near the maximum load point, and then the intensity was
saturated. From the results for the notched specimens, it was found that the
crack initiation point coincided almost with the intersection of two tangent
lines of the intensity of exo-electron emission versus displacement curve, one
of which is in the region where the intensity increases rapidly and the other is
in the region where the intensity is saturated.

various applications with concise discussion on the related health concerns.
Owing to the efficient photocatalytic properties of nano titania particles along
with high stability, super hydrophilicity and low cost, these particles are
perfect candidate for the production for coatings on the surfaces of
construction materialse. tiles, facades, wall etc. The nano titania coatings are
capable of decomposing dust, dirt and organic pollutants in the presence of
sunlight. These decomposed products may then easily be washed away by rinsing
thus providing easy cleaning and keeps the buildings in younger or fresh look

Representation of electron backscatter diffraction data. Current methods of data
representation for electron backscatter diffraction EBSD measurements are

a relatively straightforward procedure, and EBSD software packages are used to
represent these data as qualitative statistics in the form of ideal
orientations, pole figures, inverse pole figures, Euler space, and
RodriguesFrank space. Quantitative statistics in the form of secondary
computations allow full microtextural analysis. Additionally, the power of EBSD
is demonstrated through positional information representation. Through
experimental examples, the conversion of EBSD data to statistical information to
facilitate interpretation of results is demonstrated.MST/3678

Structure formation and macrosegregation under different process conditions
during DC casting. Billets of an Al4.5wt.% Cu alloy direct-chill cast under
different process conditions were systematically examined. Effects of casting
speed and water-flow rate on structure and macrosegregation profiles are studied
and correlated to computer simulated solidification patterns. The results show
that grain size, dendritic arm spacing, amount and size of pores tend to coarsen
towards the center of a billet and with decreasing casting speed and water-flow
rate. Both decreasing casting speed and water-flow rate produce less
macrosegregation, although the effect of casting speed is much larger. Computer
simulation was used to determine the geometry of the billet sump, temperature
and melt flow patterns. Main parameters that influence the structure formation
and macrosegregation during direct-chill casting are shown to be the depths of
the liquid pool and the sump, and the flow pattern in the slurry region. The
appearance of coarse grains in the central part of the billet is explained from
the transport of solid phase within the slurry region.

Laser annealing of zinc oxide thin film deposited by spray-CVD. A
polycrystalline ZnO film was deposited on quartz and silicon substrates by a
spray-CVD method. The deposited film was annealed by thermal and by laser
heating. Both CWCO2 laser and pulsed excimer XeCl lasers were used for the
purpose. The as-grown film and the annealed film were analysed for crystallinity
and compositions by XRD, for surface morphology by SEM, for band gap by optical
absorption and for electrical parameters by Van der Pauw and Hall effect
measurements. While the excimer laser annealing improved the crystallinity with
higher laser power density, CWCO2 laser incorporated the crystallinity only at
low power. High power CO2 laser annealing damaged the ZnO surface with the
creation of more defects. This was verified by SEM morphology studies. There was
no change in band gap which ensures no formation of any other phase in ZnO due
to annealing effects. The increase in resistivity both by thermal and pulsed
laser annealing was confirmed by Van der Panw resistivity measurements. The
majority carrier concentration and mobility were determined by Hall effect
measurements.

Thermal stability of boron electrical activation in preamorphised ultra-shallow
junctions. We present a detailed study of the thermal stability of activated
junctions as a function of the post-annealing conditions. p+/n junctions were
formed by implanting 500 eV boron 1 1015 cm2 into Ge+ preamorphised Si followed
by solid phase epitaxial growth SPEG at. Post-annealing temperatures ranged from
250 to, with times ranging from 3 to 1800 s. Four point probe 4PP, secondary ion
mass spectrometry SIMS and transmission electron microscopy TEM analysis were
then used to investigate the evolution of boron activation, boron diffusion and
of the implantation induced extended defects. During isothermal anneals in the
range, it is found that the sheet resistance initially increases deactivation
and then decreases reactivation with rates proportional to the temperature
itself. TEM results elucidate the crucial role of the extended defects in the
deactivation process. On the other hand, the combination of 4PP and SIMS
measurements allows to separate the respective contribution of both cluster
dissolution and dopant in-diffusion to the reactivation process.

Novel Approach of Electroshock Treatment for Defect Repair in Near- Titanium
Alloy Manufactured via Directed Energy Deposition. A subsecond and novel
approach of electroshock treatment EST is used in this study to repair defects
in directed-energy-deposited Ti-5Al-5Mo-5V-3Cr-1Zr near- titanium alloy. After
EST, the porosity of the specimen decreased significantly from 0.81 to 0.1 pct.
Large cracks observed at the bottom of the above mentioned near- titanium alloy
became intermittent small cracks and the number of voids decreased. The defects
in the top and middle regions of the specimens are repaired. The potential
defect repair is attributable to energy concentration, which promoted the
coalescence of defect tips, and thermal stresses, which compressed the defects
inward and closed them.

fracture toughness was improved in the duplex-phase crystals. Ductile phase
toughening by the C11b phase, deflection of crack-propagation at the lamellar

to be responsible for the increment of fracture toughness of MoSi2C11b/NbSi2C40

Effect of residual stress induced by pulsed-laser irradiation on initiation of
chloride stress corrosion cracking in stainless steel. The atmospheric corrosion
test and residual stress measurement were performed to evaluate the effect of
laser irradiation on stress corrosion cracking SCC initiation. Second-harmonic
Nd:YAG laser pulses pulse width: 10ns were irradiated on a type-304L stainless-
steel plate. The specimens were placed in a chamber at with RH=35% for the
corrosion test. When laser energies were 30 and 300mJ, cracks caused by SCC or
pitting were observed on the surface of the specimens. The cracks were
classified into two types on the basis of cumulative probability distribution;
one of the types is related to the laser irradiation condition. The mean maximum
crack depths were about 27 and 52m when laser energies were 30 and 300mJ,
respectively. These values were the same as the depth at which the tensile
residual stress was induced from the surface of the specimen by laser
irradiation. These results suggest that the maximum stress corrosion crack depth
was caused by the tensile residual stress induced by laser irradiation, and that
the crack stopped propagating when the crack depth was larger than several dozen
m in this test set. When laser pulses of 300mJ energy were irradiated on the
surface of the specimen by shot peening, the tensile stress was induced up to
20m from the surface, and the compressive stress was observed at a larger depth.
These results show that the laser irradiation is less effective in obtaining
tensile residual stress of the specimen compared to when laser pulses are
irradiated on the specimen treated by shot peening. The depth of tensile stress
obtained by laser irradiation is much shorter than that of compressive stress
obtained by shot peening.

Measurement of interfacial residual stress in SiC fiber reinforced NiCrAl alloy
composites by Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy was used to measure Raman
spectra of the inner SiC fibers and surface C-rich layers of SiC fibers,
composite precursors and SiCf/NiCrAl composites. The residual stresses of the
inner SiC fibers and surface C-rich layers were calculated, and the effect of
the Al+Al2O3 diffusion barrier layer on the interfacial residual stress in the
composites was analyzed in combination with the interface microstructure and
energy disperse spectroscopy EDS elements lining maps. The results show that the
existence of Al+Al2O3 diffusion barrier improves the compatibility of the
SiCf/NiCrAl interface, inhibits the adverse interfacial reaction, and relieves
the residual stress inside SiC fibers and at the interface of composite
material. Heat treatment can reduce the residual stress at the interface.the
heat treatment time increases, the residual stress at the interface decreases.

L-PBF was utilized to fabricate Si3N4 reinforced AlSi10Mg composites in this
study. The Response Surface Methodology RSM was employed to optimize L-PBF
processing parameters. The effects of the addition of Si3N4 on the mechanical
properties of the L-PBFed Si3N4/AlSi10Mg composites were studied. The
microstructures and phase of as-built Si3N4/AlSi10Mg composites were
characterized by scanning electron microscope SEM, transmission electron
microscope TEM and X-ray diffractometer XRD. The results showed that 10 vol%
Si3N4/AlSi10Mg composites exhibited excellent tensile strength, yield strength,

applied laser power of 193 W, scan speed of 559 mm/s, hatching space of 0.048

transfer mechanism brought about by Si3N4 particles. In L-PBF: the heat
conduction of the molten pool was hindered by Si3N4 particles, leading to a
reduction of the coarse molten pool. Simultaneously, whilst the mutual diffusion
of Al and Si elements occurred, no new brittle phases formed, which improved the
bonding strength between the Al matrix and the Si3N4 particles.

Preparation of Ultrasmooth Surfaces. Ultrasmooth and supersmooth are
unquantified descriptors commonly used to indicate surfaces with a smoothness
near the limit of the current state of the art. Such limits usually exceed the
state of confirmed, describ able technology. They are produced by a process that
is an art, and as such can be demonstrated but are often not completely capable
of being described or reproduced from following a description. In this article
we describe an approach to such processing, primarily from an optical
fabricator's viewpoint. We then review certain features of surfaces that should
be considered in the finest polishing and testing. Next, we briefly discuss
testing, mechanisms for surface preparation, theories of polishing
micromechanics, and finally we discuss techniques.

A new sustainable green protocol for production of reduced graphene oxide and
its gas sensing properties. In this report, we report a green, rapid and
scalable synthetic route for the production of reduced graphene oxide rGO using
an environment-friendly reducing agent l -glutathione/L-Glu to test its
feasibility for CO & NO2 gas sensing. The structure, morphology, and thermal
stability of as-synthesized rGO are investigated via Raman spectroscopy, Fourier
infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Field emission scanning electron
microscope, and thermal gravimetric analysis. The L-Glu-rGO shows higher sp2
carbon hybridization 42at.% than graphene oxide GO 29 at.%. The results indicate
that L-Glu-rGO exhibits good relative response at to both gases 10ppm of NO2 and
CO. Further, L-Glu-rGO shows a smaller response time 10.61s for NO2 and 5.05s
for CO than GO 16.64s, 11.92s to NO2 and CO respectively at, indicating the
potential application of L-Glu-rGO for gas sensing.

Morphological Control of Porous Structure in AlTiIntermetallics Foam
Manufactured by Reactive Precursor Process. In this paper, a novel processing
method reactive precursor method to manufacture high-melting point porous AlTi
intermetallics is investigated. Especially, morphological control of porous
structure is focused. In the reactive precursor process, precursors are made by
blending aluminum and titanium powders. The precursor is heated to ignite an
exothermic reaction so called combustion reaction between the elemental powders.
Pore formation is a well-known intrinsic feature of the combustion reaction, and
we tried to control the pore morphology. Fundamentally, the closed-cell
structure can be obtained when the maximum temperature during the reaction
exceeds the melting point of the reaction product. By blending the exothermic
agent powder in the precursor, the maximum temperature is increased and the
reaction products are melted. The porosity is controlled by the maximum
temperature. In contrast, an open-cell porous structure can be obtained when the
maximum temperature is below the melting point of the reaction product.
Microwave heating turned out to be an effective method to create an open cell
structure. A powdery substance that does not react with other elemental powders
heat-absorbing agent powder decreases the temperature during the reaction.
Closed, open and bimodal-sized open pores have been achieved by the reactive
precursor process so far.

layers before hole-blocking layer HBL or metal cathode deposition was conducted
on tris-phenyl-pyridyl-iridium complex, Irppy 3 -based phosphorescent organic
light-emitting devices PHOLED. The devices were fabricated in the same run with
a standard device without annealing for comparison, with an identical structure
of indium tin oxide ITO/copper phthalocyanine CuPc 10nm/ N , N -dinaphthalene-l-

used was 60, 80 and, before deposition of BCPHBL or before Mg:Ag cathode,
respectively. It was found that, before BCP deposition, in situ post-growth
annealing improves performance of the device, and the devices decay
significantly with 80 and annealing. The in situ post-growth annealed organic

Plasma assisted metal-organic chemical vapor deposition of hard chromium nitride
thin film coatings using chromium3+ acetylacetonate as the precursor. A new
technique has been developed for depositing hard nanocrystalline chromium
nitride CrN thin films on metallic and ceramic substrates using plasma assisted
metal-organic chemical vapor deposition PAMOCVD technique. In this low
temperature and environment-friendly process, a volatile mixture of chromium3+
acetylacetonate and either ammonium iodide or ammonium bifluoride were used as
precursors. Nitrogen and hydrogen have been used as the gas precursors. By
optimizing the processing conditions, a maximum deposition rate of 0.9 m/h was
obtained. A comprehensive characterization of the CrN films was carried out
using X-ray diffraction XRD, microhardness, and microscopy. The microstructure
of the CrN films deposited on well-polished stainless steel SS showed globular
particles, while a relatively smooth surface morphology was observed for
coatings deposited on polished yittria-stabilized zirconia YSZ.

Impact resistance of uncoated SiC/SiC composites. Two-dimensional woven SiC/SiC
composites fabricated by melt infiltration method were impact tested at room
temperature and at in air using 1.59-mm diameter steel-ball projectiles at
velocities ranging from 115 to 400 m/s. The extent of substrate damage with
increasing projectile velocity was imaged and analyzed using optical and
scanning electron microscopy, and non-destructive evaluation NDE methods such as
pulsed thermography, and computed tomography. The impacted specimens were
tensile tested at room temperature to determine their residual mechanical
properties. Results indicate that at 115 m/s projectile velocity, the composite
showed no noticeable surface or internal damage and retained its as-fabricated
mechanical properties.the projectile velocity increased above this value, the
internal damage increased and mechanical properties degraded: At velocities >300
m/s, the projectile penetrated through the composite, but the composite retained
approx.50% of the ultimate tensile strength of the as-fabricated composite and
exhibited non-brittle failure. Predominant internal damages are delamination of
fiber plies, fiber fracture and matrix shearing.

Kinetics of dendritic growth under the influence of convective flow in
solidification of undercooled droplets. In the present work, the results on
dendritic growth with forced convective flow are discussed. The results are
obtained for solidification of a pure nickel melt in an electromagnetically
levitated droplet. It is shown that the upstream flow imposed on the growing
dendrite enhances the growth velocity of the dendritic tips growing in the
opposite direction to the flow. Using the model of dendritic growth with
convection, we are computing the dendrite growth velocity versus undercooling
and explain in part the disagreement of experimental data with previous model
predictions for small undercoolings.

Combustion Synthesis of ZnAl2O4Catalyst Using Glycine as Fuel for the
Esterification and Transesterification of Soybean Oil: Influence the Form of
Heating. The aim of this work is to evaluate the esterification and
transesterification activity of ZnAl2O4 catalysts obtained by different ways of
heating during the combustion synthesis using glycine as fuel. Samples were
prepared according to the propellants and explosives theory using a vitreous
silica crucible as container, and as heating source, plate, muffle furnace and
microwave oven. After synthesis, the samples were structural and morphologically
characterized by: XRD, nitrogen adsorption and carbon content analysis, and
employed in the esterification and transesterification reactions, the percentage
of biodiesel formed FAME was determined by gas chromatography. The samples
obtained on the plate, muffle furnace and microwave showed that even using
different heating ways, led to the formation of ZnAl2O4 as majority phase, with
crystallite sizes of 11, 15 and 10 nm, respectively. The samples present values
of surface area ranging from 16 to 77 m 2 /g, particle size from 17 to 81 nm,
and carbon content lower than 11%. The forms used for heating influenced the
esterification and transesterification reactions, showing that there was a gap
in the production of biodiesel, which is a promising indication that this
material has potential to be used as catalysts on the biodiesel production.

Laser-induced desorption of Na-dimers. We find that Na-dimers are desorbed in a
thermal process if rough Na surfaces are irradiated with pulsed laser light of
=532 nm. In contrast, for light of =355 nm, Na2 can be detached in a non-thermal
reaction at low laser fluences. This is concluded from the kinetic energy
distributions of the dimers determined by time-of-flight measurements using a
second laser at =248 nm for photoionization. The transition from non-thermal to
thermal desorption at large fluences of the laser light can also be identified.

Technology-driven design of MMC squeeze cast connecting-rods. Continuous-

rods for racing car engines, aiming to investigate crucial aspects and propose
solutions.a consequence of material peculiarities, the shape of the connecting
rod is firstly optimised to make the fibres placement as efficient as possible;
then a mould adequate for the production is developed. The design consists in a
preliminary kinematics study, devoted to compare the loads acting on
conventional and MMC connecting rods; then a 3-D FEM analysis is carried out,
enabling the definite dimensioning. The mould is developed for complying to
several requirements,e. the assessment of adequate fibres positioning and
tensioning systems, inert to thermalmechanical effects; the design of casting
sprues, runners and gates able to guarantee easy filling and good wetting; the
optimisation of moulding assembling. The production phase implies the set-up of
techniques for fibres winding by means of a suitable coil winder, matrix casting
and item de-moulding. The final characterisation, consisting of static tensile
proof testing, radiographic and microscopic investigation, allows to assess the
soundness of the technology as well as the effectiveness of the precautions
implemented to optimise its adoption.

for different water content of siltstone uniaxial loading process are analyzed,
the results show that: 1 siltstone compressive strength decreases as the water
content is increased, the damage of water to siltstone with increasing moisture
content increases. 2 The water mass fraction 2.551% is a key point of the impact
of water to the siltstone strength change rate. Below 2.551%, with the mass
fraction of water increases the compressive strength of sandstone decrease rate
increases; higher than 2.551%, with the mass fraction of water increases the

design. By means of a novel flake powder assembly approach, thepossessed high
compatibility with Ti flakes and achieved uniform dispersion in matrix. Powder
mixtures were consolidated through low-temperature sintering and short-time heat
treatment strategy to simultaneously manipulate the interface reaction and
microstructure. Compared with the unreinforced Ti matrix, GNFs/Ti composites
were shown to obtain significantly improved strength. Specially, the 0.46 vol%
GNFs/Ti composite heat-treated at for 450s exhibited the exceptional well
ductility with a superior high compressive yield strength of ~2 GPa, which was
interpreted by the strong GNFs-Ti interface, and the extrinsic toughening effect
as a result of the laminated microstructure and improvement of matrix grain
bonding. This work provided a feasible way to construct the high performance

Strength properties and enhanced plasticity of intermetallic TiAlCrSi alloys.
Alloying elements of transition metals show strong influences on the
microstructure and mechanical properties, like tensile strength, plasticity and
fracture toughness of two-phase intermetallic -TiAl/ 2 -Ti3Al alloys.
Considerable improvements in strength and room temperature ductility have been
achieved by chromium and silicon additions to Ti52Al48 . Transmission electron
microscopy investigations revealed clearly that deformation twinning by glide of
a /6 121 or a /3 121 partial dislocations is the dominant deformation mechanism
at room and elevated temperature. From microstructural observations it is
concluded that chromium lowers the stacking fault energy and also the antiphase
boundary energy in -TiAl.

A Systematic Review on the Mechanical, Tribological, and Corrosion Properties of
Al7075 Metal Matrix Composites Fabricated through Stir Casting Process.
Aluminium alloy components are used in lightweight engineering applications and
lack mechanical properties, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. When hard
reinforcement particulates are dispersed in the aluminium matrix alloy,
aluminium matrix compositesare formed. This new material exhibits enhanced
properties such as better specific stiffness, specific strength, corrosion
resistance, elastic modulus, wear resistance, and lightweight.have many
favorable properties compared to their alloy and extensive applications.
Especially, in the space industry, where weight reduction and an increase in
modulus are prevalent, the strength-to-weight ratio is more important. This
study focuses on the tribological, mechanical, and corrosion properties of
Al7075 metal matrix compositesreinforced with one or more particulates such as
aluminium oxide Al2O3, boron carbide B4C, titanium carbide TiC, silicon carbide
SiC, titanium dioxide TiO2, and titanium diboride TiB2. In the reinforcements
are incorporated by either the solid or liquid metallurgy route. The study
addresses the findings and shortcomings in the preparation ofwith reinforcements
and their improvement in corrosion resistance, wear resistance, mechanical
properties, and lower coefficient of thermal expansion than the Al7075 base
alloy. A comprehensive survey of reinforcement particulates inand their
influences are outlined from the literature, encompassing recent research trends
to enhance the structural properties.

Luminescence measurements on MOS tunnel diodes as a method of finding the photon
emission rates in silicon. This paper contains a description of a procedure for
determining the rates of photon generation by hot electrons in silicon. The
algorithm proposed presumes the mathematical processing of experimental
radiation spectra of forward-biased MOS tunnel structures on p-Si. These
structures allow a quasimonoenergetic injection of electrons and are capable of
emitting light. The electron energy may be varied within the range of several
eV, depending on the insulator thickness used. Some practical problems, such as
the elimination of a thermal component from the spectra and the corrections for
a re-absorption of emitted photons, are given attention to. The approbation of a
proposed algorithm will remain, however, beyond the scope of this work.

BR46 as a model pollutant from textile industry. XRD, SEM, TEM, DRS, and EDX
techniques were used for the characterization of the prepared nanoparticles. The
coupling NiO as a p-type semiconductor with TiO2 as an n-type semiconductor

able to facilitate the separation of the electronhole pairs and thus improve
photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanoparticles. TiO2/NiO coupled

Characterizing the Exchange Interaction of SmCo/Co and Fe65Co35 Magnetic Films.
Exchange interaction plays an important role on magnetic properties of
nanocomposite magnets consisting of hard- and soft-magnetic phases. Here the
exchange interaction in the SmCo/Co and Fe65Co35 magnetic films was
characterized by measuring static mrH and demagnetized mdH remanence curves.
According to conventional method: delta mH=mdH - 1 - 2mrH, the exchange
interaction was evaluated. The switching fields H-p1 and H-p, at which static
mrH and demagnetized mdH remanence show the fastest change, were identified. The
relative ratio eta=H-p-H-p1/H-p of switching fields Hp' and Hp has a linear
relationship with the maximum value of delta mH curves, proposing an alternative
way to characterize the exchange interaction.

Cytocompatibility property evaluation of gas pressure sintered SiAlONSiC
composites with L929 fibroblast cells and Saos-2 osteoblast-like cells. Although
the oxide ceramics have widely been investigated for their biocompatibility,
non-oxide ceramics, such as SiAlON and SiC are yet to be explored in detail.
Lack of understanding of the biocompatibility restricts the use of these
ceramics in clinical trials. It is hence, essential to carry out proper and
thorough study to assess cell adhesion, cytocompatibility and cell viability on
the non-oxide ceramics for the potential applications. In this perspective, the
present research work reports the cytocompatibility of gas pressure sintered
SiAlON monolith and SiAlONSiC composites with varying amount of SIC, using
connective tissue cells L929 and bone cells Saos-2. The quantification of cell
viability using MTT assay reveals the non-cytotoxic response. The cell viability
has been found to be cell type dependent. An attempt has been made to discuss
the cytocompatibility of the developed composites in the light of SiC content
and type of sinter additives. C2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Temperature dependent elastic properties of nanocrystalline Co1ZnFe2O4.
Nanocrystalline Co1xZnxFe2O40 x1 powders were synthesized using the microwave
hydrothermal method at different synthesis conditions. The synthesized powders
were characterized by XRD and TEM. The average particle size was obtained from
TEM and it is found to be 17nm. Then the powders were sintered using the
microwave sintering method at/15min. A detailed study of elastic behavior of
Co0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 has been undertaken using a composite piezoelectric oscillator
method over a temperature range of. The elastic modulus of all the ferrites was
found to decrease with an increase in the temperature, except near the Curie
temperature TC, where a small anomaly is observed. The above observations were
carried in the demagnetized state;the application of a 380mT magnetic field
allowed us to reach the saturated state of the sample at any one of the
measuring temperatures. The anomaly observed in the thermal variation of elastic
moduli is qualitatively explained with the help of temperature variation of
magneto-crystalline anisotropy constant.

MnSPrecipitation Behavior of High-Sulfur Microalloyed Steel Under Sub-rapid
Solidification Process. A typical high-sulfur microalloyed steel was
investigated by a sub-rapid solidification process for grain refinement of the
as-cast microstructure. The size and distribution characteristics of the MnS
precipitates were analyzed. The variations in the dendrite morphology and
secondary dendrite arm spacing SDAS under different cooling rates have been
studied, which strongly influence the precipitation behavior of MnS. The
3D-morphology of MnS precipitates was revealed by a novel saturated picric acid
deep-etching method. Most MnS precipitates with a length smaller than 5 m were
columnar or equiaxed in the corresponding dendrite zones under sub-rapid
solidification conditions at cooling rates of 261 to/s. Furthermore, an area
scan analysis of the precipitates showed the number of small MnS per square
millimeter with lengths lower than 3 m decrease from 200,537 to 110,067. The
percentage of large MnS with a length over 5 m increased from 2.6 to 6.2pct as
the solidification condition changed from sub-rapid to air cooling. In addition,
the size of MnS precipitate was found to depend linearly on the SDAS.

Effect of hexagonal boron nitride and calcined petroleum coke on friction and
wear behavior of phenolic resin-based friction composites. Calcined petroleum
coke CPC and hexagonal boron nitride h-BN were used as the friction modifiers to
improve the friction and wear properties of phenolic resin-based friction
composites. Thus, the composites with different relative amounts of CPC and h-BN
as the friction modifiers were prepared by compression molding. The hardness and
bending strength of the friction composites were measured. The friction and wear
behaviors of the composites sliding against cast iron at various temperatures
were evaluated using a pin-on-disc test rig. The worn surfaces and wear debris
of the friction composites were analyzed by means of scanning electron
microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy. It was found that the hybrid of the two friction modifiers was
effective to significantly decrease the wear rate and stabilize the friction
coefficient of the friction composites at various temperatures by forming a
uniform lubricating and/or transferred film on the rubbing surfaces. The uniform
and durable transfer films were also able to effectively diminish the direct
contact between the friction composite and the cast iron counterpart and hence
prevent severe wear of the latter as well. The effectiveness of the hybrid of
CPC and h-BN in improving the friction and wear behavior of the phenolic resin-
based friction modifiers could be attributed to the complementary action of the
low temperature lubricity of CPC and the high temperature lubricity of h-BN. The
optimum ratio of the two friction modifiers CPC and h-BN in the friction
composites was suggested to be 1:1, and the corresponding friction composite
showed the best friction-reducing and antiwear abilities.

SiC. We report the development of an absorption measurement-based
characterization tool for the quantitative determination of doping levels and
their lateral distribution in silicon carbide wafers. Calibration plots for the
technologically important silicon carbide polytypes 4HSiC n-/p-type, 6HSiC
n-/p-type and 15RSiC n-type are presented. A review of the underlying physical
effects of the measurement procedure as well as a description of the
experimental setup is given. The applicability of the characterization tool as a

Ultrasensitive and reusable SERS platform based on Ag modified WO3 nanoflakes
for catechol detection. Novel incorporation of silver nanoparticles Agon
tungsten trioxide nanoflakes by the in-situ process has been demonstrated. The
AgNP@WO 3 -NF nanostructures are used as SERS substrates for ultrasensitive
detection of catechol CT. The AgNP@WO 3 -NF nanostructures offer ultra-low limit
of detection, high analytical enhancement factor, excellent uniformity and show
a proficient sensing ability in tap-water samples. The self-reviving ability of
the AgNP@WO 3 -NF nanostructures by the UV-irradiation process shows their
excellent reusability on a single substrate for the SERS detection of CT.
Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS using the noble-metal/semiconductor
hybrid nanostructures are attractive for the real-world detection of organic
pollutants due to the unique fingerprint information for analytes and the
ultrasensitive detection ability by electromagnetic and chemical mechanisms. In
this work, we constructed noble-metal/semiconductor nanostructures by the in-
situ deposition of silver nanoparticles Agon tungsten trioxide nanoflakes WO3
for the SERS applications. By virtue of the synergistic action of Agand WO3 the
AgNP@WO 3 -NF nanostructures possess the superior SERS performance, such as
ultra-low limit of detection 2.09 10 -10 M, large analytical enhancement factor
3.90 10 8 , high uniformity less than 8.95%, and good reproducibility 5.20%, for
the determination of phenolic derivative, catechol CT. By its trace-level
detection ability, the AgNP@WO 3 -NF nanostructure is employed to detect CT in
tap water and the obtained results show satisfactory recovery values with high
sensitivity. Moreover, the self-reviving ability of AgNP@WO 3 -NF nanostructure
is demonstrated by the photocatalytic degradation of CT. The experimental
results show that the AgNP@WO 3 -NF nanostructure has good detection ability of
CT in the five-cycle reusability test. This work paves the way to explore the
predominant advantages of noble-metal/semiconductor nanostructure with
ultrasensitive and reusable properties for food safety monitoring in real-world
applications.

Structural, electrical and optical properties of sintered SnO2 pellets. Tin
dioxide SnO2 powder was prepared by the co-precipitation method using SnCl2
solution as a precursor. The powder was then pelletized and sintered. Structural
characterization of the samples with XRD confirmed that all the pellets were of
SnO2 having polycrystalline nature with the crystallite size of the order of 90
nm. SEM-EDAX was used to confirm the morphology and composition of the samples.
The measurements of electrical properties were carried out in the frequency
range of 100 Hz to 100 kHz at various fixed temperatures from to. The a.c.
conductivity and the dielectric constant were found to be dependent on both
frequency and temperature. The frequency and temperature dependent conduction
properties of SnO2 are found to be in accordance with correlated barrier hoping
model. Infrared and visible spectroscopic studies show that a strong vibration
band characteristic of the SnO2 stretching mode was present at around 620 cm 1

Microstructural refinement of an As-cast Al-12.6 wt pct Si alloy by repeated
thermomechanical treatment to produce a heavily deformable material. A certain
degree of cold working is advantageous in developing a fine microstructure with
minute silicon crystals for eutectic and/or hypereutectic AlSi cast alloys. A
novel process, repeated thermomechanical treatment RTMT, was applied to an
Al-12.6 wt pct Si cast alloy. The process involves multiple-pass cold working
less than a 20 pct reduction in section area and heat treatment at for 3.6 ks.
Cold-work annealing was repeated up to about an 80 pct reduction in section from
the beginning. The RTMT material showed a refined microstructure with high
ductility. Most silicon crystals were fragmented to only a few micrometers and
were spheroidized. The RTMT material showed such marked plasticity that it could
be wrought up to a 99 pct reduction in section at room temperature. The Cold-
worked RTMT materials exhibited an excellent balance between tensile strength
and elongation and a higher strain hardening than the cast material.

Diffusion of oxygen molecules in fluorine-doped amorphous SiO2. Effects of
fluorine doping on the diffusion of interstitial oxygen molecules O2 in
amorphous SiO2 a-SiO2 were compared to those obtained from a-SiO2 containing
SiOH groups. Incorporation of moderate concentration 1 0 19 cm3 of SiF groups
gives rise to minor changes in diffusion parameters between 800 and: only a
slight decrease in solubility and an increase in the activation energy for
diffusion can be detected. Incorporation of SiOH groups has similar weak effects
on the solubility and activation energy for diffusion. These minor changes are
most likely due to the enhancement of the flexibility of local SiO network as a
result of the dissociation of the network by SiOH and SiF groups. However, in
contrast to the SiF doping, SiOH doping leads to a notable decrease in the
diffusion coefficient. The heat of solution changes by 0.1 0.2eV at and it is
attributed to the glass transition of a-SiO2.

A framework for generating synthetic diffraction images from deforming

generating synthetic diffraction images on X-ray detectors from individual
grains within polycrystals under in situ loading is described. Crystal
plasticity-based finite element simulations of three-dimensional 3D
polycrystalline aggregates undergoing deformation were utilized to mimic a far-
field High Energy Diffraction Microscopy HEDM experiment. The smearing of the
diffraction spots on a two-dimensional 2D area detector was consistent between
the experiment and simulation for a target grain within a polycrystalline sample
of a CuCrZr alloy. The influence of crystallographic neighborhood and grain
shape on the diffracted intensity distributions of the diffraction spots, the
stress distribution and the misorientation distribution within a grain is also
investigated. Key features of the diffraction spots are examined,
differentiating between changes with applied stress and changes due to lattice
misorientation associated with plastic straining.

Effect of Electric Field Strength on Texture Evolution of IFSteel Sheet during
Annealing. Specimens cut from a cold-rolled IF steel sheet of 1 mm thickness
were respectively annealed at for 20min under a range of DC electric fields
1kV/cm~4kV/cm. The Effect of electric field strength on recrystallization
texture of IF steel sheet was studied by mean of X-ray diffraction ODF analysis.
It was found that -fiber textures were notably enhanced as electric field
strength increased. The strength of -fiber textures got their peak values as the
applied electric field reached to 4kV/cm. The possible reason for such phenomena
was discussed in the viewpoint of interaction between the applied electric field
and the orientation-dependent stored-energy in deformed metals which is known as
the driving force for recrystallization during annealing.

Modelling the evolution of geometrically necessary boundaries at large plastic
strains. In polycrystals undergoing large plastic strains, the strain
compatibility between adjacent misoriented areas is usually ensured by the
activation of different slip system combinations leading to localised
orientation gradients. The latter are accommodated by or Geometrically Necessary
Boundaries, of increasing misorientation. A new model is developed for the
evolution of a GNB between two crystallites under multiple slip conditions. This
model takes the crystal plasticity of each cell block into account using a
TaylorBishopHill approach and leads to a dynamic accommodation of the boundary
disorientation on the basis of dislocation arrays. In particular the optimal
dislocation configuration of theis obtained by minimising the sub-boundary
energy within the range of conditions imposed by the slip system kinematics.
Applied to the case of plane strain compression of fcc crystals, the model shows
that the GNB dislocation lattice is very sensitive to the initial grain
orientations, stable texture components like Brass {110}112 or S {123}634
leading to the lowest dislocation densities. The strain path and the relative
positions of the misorientation axis and boundary plane normal also have an
influence on the final dislocation structure, albeit to a smaller extent.

Woven Structures from Natural Fibres for Reinforcing Composites. The increase of
production of woven structures from natural fibres for reinforced composites can
be noticed in different sectors of economy. This can be explained by limited
sources of raw materials and different environmental issues, as well as European
Union guidelines for car manufacture 4. This research produced 2D textile
structures of hemp yarn and polypropylene yarn and tested the impact of added
glass fibre yarn on the mechanical properties of the woven structures and the
composites produced from them. The woven structures were manufactured using hand
looms or industrial looms C-175 using one layer technique. The mechanical
testing of the reinforcements showed that the parameters of the looms had
significant impact on the properties of the reinforcements. However, the desired
improvement of strength by adding glass fibre to the fabric was not achieved.
The one, two, three and four layer composites were produced in a hydraulic press
using reinforcements woven from hemp yarn and polypropylene yarn. The mechanical
testing of composites showed that the tensile strength of the composites and the
tensile stress at maximum load depends on number of the reinforcement layers,
but the tensile extension of the composites and the modulus of elasticity are
not closely related to the number of reinforcement layers, but rather on
elasticity of yarn used in weaving. Swelling of composites in water was
detected.

Austenite Grain Size Refinement of Multi-Microalloyed Low Carbon Steel Using
Severe Plastic Deformation at High Temperature. The effect of hot deformation
behavior on austenite grain size refinement of low carbon multi-microalloyed
steel was investigated. The morphology of austenite grains was revealed by
thermal etching and observed using optical microscope. The results showed that
single pass compression can only marginally refine austenite grain size by
dynamic recrystallization, even under severe plastic deformation. However, when
the specimens were held for a while after hot deformation, the fine austenite
grain size can be obtained due to static recrystallization behavior.

Containerless rapid solidification of highly undercooled CoSi eutectic alloys.
Droplets of Co62.1%Si and Co43.5%Si eutectic alloys with different sizes are
rapidly solidified during containerless processing in drop tube. The
microstructures of Co62.1%Si eutectic alloy are mainly characterized by lamellar
eutectic plus anomalous eutectic of CoSi2 and Si phases, whereas those of
Co43.5%Si eutectic alloy are mainly characterized by lamellar eutectic plus
anomalous eutectic of CoSi and CoSi2 phases. For both alloys, the experimental
results show that the microstructural evolution depends mainly on undercooling.
In the case of Co62.1%Si eutectic alloy, the smaller the droplet diameter, the
larger the volume fraction of anomalous eutectic. When its diameter is very
small, the droplet exhibits anomalous eutectic morphology entirely.for Co43.5%Si
eutectic alloy, with the decrease of droplet size, the microstructural
transition proceeds from lamellar eutectic to anomalous eutectic, even to
dendrites. The nucleation rates of each phase have been calculated. The TMK
eutectic growth and LKT/BCT dendritic growth theories are applied to analyze the
rapid solidification process and investigate the microstructural transition
mechanisms. The coupled zone around Co43.5%Si eutectic alloy has also been
calculated on the basis of TMK and LKT/BCT models, which covers a composition
ranging from 40.8 to 43.8%Si. And calculated coupled zone of Co62.1%Si covers a
composition ranging from 60.2 to 81.6%Si.

On the cavity-growth-model-based prediction of the stress dependence of time to
creep fracture. A model describing intergranular cavity growth and cavity shape
evolution during its growth is applied to the numerical study of the growth of
cavities by coupled diffusion and power-law creep, and to predict the stress
dependence of time to creep fracture. It is shown that at stresses at which the
power-law creep represents an important component of the growth the predicted
time to fracture is inversely proportional to the third power of stress
independent of the values of the ratio of surface diffusion to grain boundary
diffusion conductance, while the minimum creep rate varies with approximately
the fifth power of stress. Even if the cavity nucleation process is taken into
account, assuming that the nucleation rate is proportional to the power-law
creep rate, the predicted time to fracture is not inversely proportional to the
creep rate,e. to the fifth power of stress. This contradicts the commonly
observed proportionality of the product of time to fracture and minimum creep
rate to the creep strain to fracture modified Monkman-Grant M-G relationship.
The analysis made suggests that the experimentally observed validity of the
modified M-G relationship is always associated with the constrained cavity
growth which cannot proceed unless accomodated by power-law creep.

The influence of recycled concrete aggregate on the properties of concrete. Use
of Recycled Coarse Aggregate RCA in concrete can be described in terms of
environmental protection and economy. This paper deals with the mechanical
properties of concrete compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, modulus

tested, concrete made with Natural Coarse Aggregate NCA as a control concrete
and two types of concrete made with recycled coarse aggregate 50% and 100%
replacement level of coarse recycled aggregate. These kinds of concrete were
made with different targets of compressive strength of concrete f c 35MPa and 70
MPa. Fifty specimens were tested of the fresh and hardened properties of
concrete. The waste concrete from laboratory test cubes was crushed to produce
the Recycled Coarse Aggregate used in recycled concrete. A comparative between
the experimental results of the properties for fresh and hardened concrete is
presented in the paper. Recycled aggregate concrete RCA had a satisfactory
performance despite the replacement ratios. It was found using the size of
Recycled Coarse Aggregate RCA of 5-14 mm has quite similar in performance with
the same size of Natural Coarse Aggregate NCA, it is necessary to use high
quality of recycled concrete with low levels of impurities. Recycled aggregate
as an alternative to natural aggregates -seems quite successful.

Characterization of quantum well structures using surface photovoltage
spectroscopy. In this work a novel method to characterize quantum well QW
structures and devices is presented. The method is based on the well-known
surface photovoltage spectroscopy SPS and on numerical simulations. It is shown
that the surface photovoltage is sensitive to the electron hole energy
transition levels in the well layer as well as to features of other regions of
the structure. The photovoltaic response as function of well width is
numerically studied and is found to increase with decreasing well width.a result
of the spectra analysis growth parameters such as quantum well width and ternary
layer composition both of quantum well and cladding layers are accurately
determined. In addition, structure properties such as electric fields and
effective carriers lifetime at the well are estimated. Finally it is shown that
operating device parameters such the lasing wavelength may also be obtained. The
results demonstrate the power of SPS as a characterization method for QW

Mold slag property measurements to characterize CC mold - Shell gap phenomena.
Multi-faceted experiments were conducted to measure the properties of several
mold slags, needed for fundamental characterization of heat transfer and
friction in the interfacial gap between the shell and mold during the continuous
casting of steel. A novel apparatus was used to measure the friction coefficient
between solidified mold flux and copper at elevated temperatures. The measured
softening temperature is interpreted to extrapolate the slag viscosity-
temperature curves far into the low temperature - high viscosity region.
Continuous-cooling transformation curves were extracted from XRD analysis of DSC
test samples and thermocouple dip tests. Time-temperature transformation curves
were obtained from similar analysis of melted mold powder samples that were
atomized into droplets, quenched to form glass, and then partially devitrified

Effects of clustercluster interactions on the structure and magnetic properties
in Fe62. The structure and magnetic properties of the coupled Fe6 :Fe 6 cluster
have been systematically studied with the density functional formalism, and the
KohnSham equation is solved self-consistently with the discrete variational
method DVM. It is found that as the intercluster distance decreases the clusters
are deformed, which results in the sensitive changes of magnetic moments. The
clustercluster coupling energy indicates that the two clusters are weakly
coupled, and the HOMO-LUMO gap of the coupled clusters is so small that the two
coupled Fe6 clusters are nearly metallic, and the metalnonmetal transition can
be realized by coupling and decoupling of clusters.

The research of printability and microstructure of SnAgCu solder paste. The
final performance of the product was directly affected by the printing quality
of the solder paste and the microstructure of the welding spot.A suitable
printing and welding process were gained through the study of the solder paste
printing performance and the welding spot microstructure,thereby the final
product performance and the application result were enhanced greatly.In this
paper,SnAgCu alloy powder which was produced by the method of close-coupled gas
atomization was used as raw materials.Different solder paste was prepared by
changing the mass fraction of alloyed powder,and then the rheological properties
and collapse performance of the solder paste as well as the microstructure of
the welding spot were studied.The rotational rheometer and scanning electron
microscopy was used to examine the rheological properties of the solder paste
and the microstructure of the welding spot.The result indicated that:1 The
viscosity of the solder paste increased with the improving of the alloyed powder
mass fraction,but the viscosity of the solder paste decreased with the increase
of angular velocity.2When mass fraction of the paste prepared by alloyed powder
is 87.5%,the paste viscosity is 256.6 Pas.This paste is suitable for
printing.3Solder pots after welding are round,full and bright,with a small
amount of flux residue.And the IMC layer thickness is 510 m,composed of Cu6Sn5.

Effect of ultrafiltration membranes properties and channel configuration on
membrane fouling and performance. The work describes the existing views on
colloidal, suspended and organic fouling in ultrafiltration UF membrane modules
using for natural water treatment. The paper presents the results of the
experimental research allowing for a quantitative determination of sorption and
plugging rates, and for evaluation of their effect on membrane performance loss
over time. Small colloidal particles pose a risk to UF unit due pore plugging;
especially when membranes treat water with a very low content of suspended
solids. This effect often cannot be detected during short-time pilot tests, but
it can have a decisive influence on the operation of a membrane unit. Study of
the filterability characteristic of water contaminants enables us to forecast
the filtration type on UF membranes and to evaluate their performance losses.
The paper also describes the effect of a feed channel structure in particular, a
presence of a feed spacer in spiral wound membrane modules on channel hydraulic
resistance growth. The technique of channel resistance estimation, depending on
suspended particles concentration in the source water, is presented.

Multiaxial Plastic Behavior of Prestrained Mild Steel and Its Analysis by a
Subsequent Yield Function of the Sixth Degree.. The subsequent yield function
previously proposed by one of the authors is modified by introducing the fourth
rank tensor of anisotropic moduli. This yield function accounts for the effects
of the third deviatoric stress invariant and anisotropy and the Bauschinger
effect. Multiaxial loading tests are carried out on tubular specimens of mild
steel subjected to various amounts of torsional prestrain. Two modes of loading
are used to assess the theoretical predictions: one is the combined tension-
torsion and the other is off-axis torsion by means of the combined loading of
compression, internal pressure and torsion. The equi-strain loci and strain
behavior are examined as a function of prestrain at three levels of offset
strain ranging from 0.002% to 2.0%. In the tension-torsion stress field, the
equi-strain locus specified by a 0.002% offset forms a nose in the prestress
direction and flattens on the opposite side. The locus expands with increasing
offset strain, so that both the sharpness of nose and the degree of flattening
decrease. The deviation between the directions of the principal shear stress and
principal shear strain increment is determined from the off-axis torsion test.
It rises to a maximum value with a change in the principal shear stress
direction and then decreases. The maximum deviation is larger when a smaller
offset strain is used, and it increases as the prestrain becomes larger. Such
behavioral characteristics can be expressed precisely by the constitutive
equation derived from the proposed yield function, hardening law and associated
flow rule.

Investigation of beta fleck formation in Ti-17 alloy by directional
solidification method. Beta flecks are one of the most common defects occur in
some + and titanium alloys. In this study, formation of beta flecks in Ti-17
alloy was investigated by directional solidification experiments. Samples were
directionally solidified under a constant temperature gradient of 2 10/m and a
wide range of withdrawal rates R from 3 mm/h to 150 mm/h. We find that
macrostructure of the directionally solidified Ti-17 samples can be
characterized by four zones and two lines after the heat treatment. Profile of
the solid-liquid interface transits from planar to cellular to dendritic shape
with solidification rate increasing from 3 mm/h to 150 mm/h. The critical rates
for planar to cellular R c1 transition and cellular to dendritic R c2 transition
can be well predicted based on the traditional solidification theory. Dark and
light contrast areas in macrostructure are directly related to elemental
segregation. Dark contrast areas are rich of Cr, Zr but lean of Mo, while no
apparent segregation is found in light contrast areas and the mean level of Cr,
Zr is lower and Mo is higher in this area than that in dark contrast areas. We
conclude that -flecks in Ti-17 titanium alloy are induced by segregation of
alloying elements with k <1 and their shape and size are determined by
solidification conditions. Based on the findings of the present article and
other literatures, three types of -flecks are proposed and their formation
mechanisms are discussed.

Influence of microstructure and pre-straining on the bake hardening response for
ferrite-martensite dual-phase steels of different grades. This work aims to
investigate the effects of pre-straining and microstructure on bake hardening BH
response of dual phase DP steels. Four kinds of different grades of commercial
DP steels, DP340/600/, DP420/780/, DP500/780/ and DP550/980/, were pre-strained
in tension to 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, 6% and 8%, then baked at for 20min followed by
restraining, or just baked at 170, 190, 210, 230, for 20min and at for 40min
followed by straining without pre-straining. Electron backscattered diffraction
EBSD measurements and temperature-dependent internal friction measurements were
conducted to characterize geometrically necessary dislocationsand analyze solute
carbon content and interactions between point defects and dislocations in DP
steels. The results show that for all grades of DP steels investigated, BH
values increase to peak values at pre-straining ranging from 0.5% to 2% and then
decline with further pre-straining. AtBH condition of/20min, peak BH values with
pre-straining are 33MPa for DP340/600/, 34MPa for DP420/780/, 78MPa for
DP500/780/ and 90MPa for DP550/980/ respectively. Pre-straining can cause
increase in tensile strength and decrease in total elongation after baking,
especially for DP500/780/ and DP550/980/. DP steels without pre-straining can
reach very high BH0 values by applying either higher temperature or longer
holding time. Solute carbon content in ferrite controls the speed of BH response
in DP steels. Microstructures of higher volume fraction of martensite, smaller
martensite islands and smaller ferrite grains can produce higher BH values.

A Unified Definition of Stress Intensity Factors for Cracks/Corners/Interface
Cracks/Interface Corners in Anisotropic/Piezoelectric/Viscoelastic Materials. To
have a definition covering all the possible situations of singular orders real
or complex, distinct or repeated, the matrix form near tip solutions of
interface corners written by the Stroh's complex variable formalism of
anisotropic elasticity were employed in this paper. Starting from the matrix
form near tip solutions for anisotropic elastic materials, identical
mathematical expressions were applied to the cases of piezoelectric materials
and viscoelastic materials by the ways such as the expansion of the elastic
properties to include the piezoelectric effects, and the use of the Laplace
transform to make the viscoelastic stress-strain relations look like linear
elastic materials. The stress intensity factors defined through the matrix form
expression are therefore unified for several different situations. With this
unified definition, some special cases are reduced and compared with the
definitions proposed in the literature.

Fatigue Properties for Sinter-Hardened FeNiMoCu Materials. Fe-4Ni-0.5Mo-1Cu
powder was selected as raw material, pressed and sinter-hardened at for 30 min
with rapid cooling. The density varies in the range of 7.24-7.29 g/cm3. Its
fatigue properties have been tested in axial loading of alternating
tensile/compressive stress at R=-1 with a servo-pulse pump. The fatigue
endurance limit was measured to be 260 MPa. The microstructure showed more
homogeneous bainite and martensite. Neither Ni nor Mo rich areas were detected.
Fractography displayed the fatigue cracks initiated from the pore areas near the
surface. A nontypical ductile fatigue striation was found. More dimples occurred
on fracture surface due to the plastic deformation, which can prohibit cracking
propagation and improve its fatigue properties.

Optimization of Hot Rolling and Annealing Process of Low NiStainless Steel Using
Simulation Studies. Processing of low NiStainless Steel poses a serious problem
during rolling both in roughing and finishing stands owing to high load. This is
primarily attributed to high work hardening rate due to low Ni and high Mn in
such steels. An increase in temperature to bring down the rolling load
deteriorates the surface quality. In addition to this, high hardness in the cold
rolled and annealed product posses problem during further forming operation. To
overcome these problems, simulation studies were carried out using Gleeble
Thermo-mechanical Simulator i to determine flow stress under different hot
rolling conditions and ii to simulate continuous strip annealing process to
optimize annealing parameters to bring down the hardness. It was observed that
the flow stress increases gradually with a decrease in temperature till and
thereafter, at a significantly high rate. It was further observed that
continuous dynamic recovery occurred at 1050 which gradually diminished and
resulted in work hardening at lower temperatures. In view of this, rolling
schedule was modified which led to smooth rolling without any over-load problem.
It was also found based on simulation studies that the hardness was minimum in
the temperature range ofC, however, no/ little recrystallisation occurred at
these temperatures. A fully recrystallised grain with significant drop in
hardness was observed at. Annealing cycle was accordingly modified for regular
commercial production which has given good result.

Synthesis and characterization of magnetite nanoparticles having different cover
layer and investigation of cover layer effect on the adsorption of lysozyme and
bovine serum albumin. In this study, differently coated superparamagnetic Fe3O4
magnetite nanoparticles were synthesized, characterized and used for lysozyme Ly
and bovine serum albumin BSA adsorption. SiO2, carbon nanotubesand graphene were
used for covering the readily synthesized magnetite nanoparticles to elucidate
the effect of cover layer on the protein adsorption kinetics and capacities of
nanostructure. XRD, FTIR, AFM, SEM, VSM and fluorescence measurements were used
for the characterization of the samples and investigating the adsorption
kinetics of Ly and BSA by these nanoparticles. The average particle size of the
Fe3O4 nanoparticles are approximately found as 10nm and VSM measurement shows
that the Fe3O4 particles have superparamagnetic behavior with no hysteresis and
remnant. The adsorption kinetic of proteins on nanosized material is followed
via fluorescence method. All the nanostructures with different cover layers obey
pseudo first order kinetics and SiO2 coated nanoparticles show the fastest
kinetics and capabilities for Ly and BSA adsorption.

Lamellar orientation effect on fatigue crack propagation threshold in coarse
grained Ti46Al8Nb. Cast Ti46Al8Nb with coarse lamellar microstructures was
subject to fatigue crack propagation test at with R = 01. The notch region of
each testpiece contains one or one dominant lamellar colony. A strong dependence
of fatigue crack propagation threshold on lamellar orientation was found and the
lamellar colonies with their interfaces parallel to the stress axis have the
highest threshold and those 4065 off the stress axis have the lowest threshold.
It is elucidated that slip or twinning parallel to lamellar interface may
interact with cross-lamella slip or twinning to help open up microcracks in
front of the main crack.

Laparoscopic Surgical Manipulations Affect the Mechanical Properties and the
Microstructure of Polymeric Sutures. In the last years a new clinical method to
carry out surgical operations has been introduced. It consists in minimally
invasive vascular surgery also called laparoscopy. In one hand, during
laparoscopy procedures, sutures cannot be handled with fingers, and the use of
stainless-steel needle holders is required. In the other hand, companies that
fabricate sutures clearly mention that metal-made devices should be avoided when
manipulating the monofilaments. Therefore, the manipulation of the suture
monofilaments made of polymers by laparoscopic needle holders made of metals is
controversial. Literature in this field is limited and incomplete. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanical and microstructural
effects of the manipulations with laparoscopic needle holder on polymeric suture
monofilament. Surgipro polypropylene, Teflene polyvinylidene fluoride and Gore-
Tex polytetrafluoroethylene monofilament suture were pinched with a standard
clinical protocol by a surgeon. Scanning electron microscopy, micro-mechanical
testing, differential scanning calorimetry, x-ray diffraction, small angle x-ray
scattering and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were then performed.
Results showed that the ultimate tensile strength of Teflene and Gore-Tex
sutures does not change after pinching whereas it decreases significantly for
Surgipro sutures. This is attributed to stress concentration and to the
compressive strength applied on the monofilament, which are closely related to
the permanent deformation of the suture after pinching. Teflene and Gore-Tex
monofilament sutures showed to be not affected even after severe pinching with
laparoscopic needle holders. Therefore, our results clearly showed that the use
of Surgipro II sutures in laparoscopic interventions should be avoided.

Synthesis and properties of luminescent Y2O3:Tb3+5, 8, 12 wt.% nanocrystals. We
have studied the photoluminescence PL characteristics of Y2O3:Tb3+ 5wt.%Tb12wt.%
composition nanocrystal from the viewpoint of particle size, annealing effect,
amount of Tb3+ concentration and PL decay time. Nanoscale Y2O3:Tb3+ was
synthesized by a liquid-phase reaction method using yttrium acetylacetonate
hydrate CH3COCHCOCH33YxH2O as a precursor for the host lattice and CH3CO23TbxH2O
for the terbium doping. Both were dissolved in methanol at room temperature and
dried at. The synthesized Y2O3:Tb3+ was annealed at, and during 1h in air. The
particle size and PL intensity of the Y2O3:Tb3+ nanocrystal are significantly
dependent on the annealing temperature and Tb3+ concentration. At of annealing
temperature and 8wt.% of Tb3+ doping concentration, the crystallinity and PL
characteristic of the Y2O3:Tb3+ are improved meaningfully. The dominant 5D47FJ
green emission, J=6,5,4,3, transition, with sharp 5D47F5 peak, due to the cross
relaxation is observed and the corresponding PL decay time is estimated as
2.15ms. However, it needs to understand detailed decay behavior of Y2O3:Tb3+ and
it should also be pointed out that a rigorous analysis could be applied
furthermore.

Bare Spot Defect on a Hot Dip Galvanized DP Sheet Strip. Bare spots defect of
galvanealed GA in High Strength Dual Phase DP steel strip with 1.5 % Mn contain
was studied in detail. The surface morphologies of spot defects before and after
partial and complete removal of the Zn layer, as well as the interface between
the outermost coating layer and the sheet substrate were analyzed by optical
microscope OM, scanning electron microscope SEM, energy dispersive spectrometer
EDS, X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy XPS, glow discharge optical emission
spectrometry GDOES and laser scanning confocal microscopeLSCM. It was found that
the bare spots defect was composed of a large number of pits with different
sizes and depths. There were a lot of Fe - Zn alloy particles distributed in the
pits, and many MnO formed on the surface, no effective Fe2Al5 inhibition layer
formed. The results showed that the main reasons for the bare spots defect of
the GA in High Strength DP steel strip are as follows: a silicon oxide film
forms on the substrate during annealing prior to hot dipping because of Mn
gathered on the surface of steel strip, thus strip surface wettability with
liquid zinc is deteriorated and preventing the formation of the Fe2Al5
inhibition layer during hot dipping. In this paper, the dew point control
process is introduced creatively, by increasing the dew point and the hydrogen
content in the furnace area, and the bare spot defects on the surface of the
high strength duplex steel galvanized sheet are solved.

effects of the SEB in the electrical properties of the MOSFET are established,
and the SiC damaged zone is observed by scanning electron microscopy. Based on
this failure analysis at the die level, the distinct stages during the SEB
mechanism can be defined. The sensitive volume where the secondary particle
deposited enough energy to trigger the SEB mechanism is identified and located
inside the SiC n-drift epitaxial layer near the epitaxial layer/substrate

resulting microstructures. The thixoformability to cylindrical rods of a Zr-
modified zinc alloy ZA27 and the resulting microstructures were observed with
different reheating temperatures, reheating durations and mould temperatures.
The results were compared with those of an unmodified ZA27 alloy formed by semi-
solid die-casting. It was found that the formability of the Zr-modified alloy
was significantly superior to that of the unmodified one. The microstructures of
the thixoformed rods were basically uniform along their axial direction and the
primary particle fraction obviously decreased along radial direction. The
primary particle size slightly increased and the primary particle fraction
decreased with increasing reheating duration. Both the size and fraction
decreased with the increase of reheating temperature, while both of them
increased as the die temperature increased. The mould-filling process and
subsequent secondary solidification were also discussed.

Relationship Study and Primary Application between Gas Permeability and Crack
State on Bridge Joint Concrete. For evaluating the crack state on solid bridge
joint on site, the relationship between gas permeability and crack width of
joint concrete is studied both on material and structural levels in this
article. In laboratory tests, gas permeability tests on concrete samples with
macrocrack are performed, the relationship between the relative gas permeability
rate k/k 0 and the relative variation of crack width a c is established
combining with regression analysis, the fitting curve equation is . when a c
increases by 1.12510 -2 mm, the gas permeability increases about 10 times
compared with the initial state. In field tests, pulse tests are performed on
bridge joint based on 3 embedded pulse probes to measure the evolution of gas
permeability during bridge operation. The results show, firstly, the gas
permeability of joint concrete are in the order of 10 -16 ~10 -19 m 2 , which
indicates a good compaction performance; Secondly, an order of magnitude
increase of gas permeability of one probe in different ages, or the fact that
the gas permeability at one position in solid joint is obviously larger than the
other positions, these phenomena indicate the existence of original defects, or
the possibility of macrocrack appearance from microcracks, and the crack width
increases by about 0.01 mm.

Superior fatigue life of Fe-15Mn-10Cr-8Ni-4Si seismic damping alloy under
asymmetric cyclic loading with tensile mean strain. An Fe15Mn10Cr8Ni4Si in wt%
alloy was recently developed for hysteretic seismic dampers that protect
constructions against earthquakes. The alloy was found to exhibit a stable
hysteresis response and an extraordinarily long low-cycle fatigue LCF life, Nf,
under symmetric cyclic loading tension/compression strain ratio Re = 1, owing to
reversible cyclic deformation associated with e-martensitic transformation. The
LCF life and failure microstructure of the alloy were studied at Re values
ranging from 10.5, so that the strain domain of the cyclic deformation changed
from symmetric tensioncompression to asymmetric loading with tensile mean
strain. The shift of the strain to the tensile domain, which is known to
frequently have a negative effect on fatigue resistance because it induces
tensile mean stress, brought about only a moderate fluctuation in Nf Nf = 9200,
9500, 7500, and 8400 cycles at Re = 1, 0.2, 0.2, and 0.5, respectively. The
stressstrain hysteretic response remained stable, and the mean stress observed
in early cycles was relaxed to zero during cyclic deformation. This stress
relaxation is associated with strengthening of austenite texture with 111//
loading direction and suppression of the martensite fraction, which the
reversible cyclic deformation mechanism seems to sustain.

The relation of mechanical properties and local structures in bulk Mg54Cu1 x Ag
x 35 Y11 metallic glasses: Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.
Understanding the correlation of deformation and local structures in bulk metal
glassesis essential for the developing new types of amorphous alloys and their
engineering applications. We investigate the relation of local structures and
mechanical properties for Mg_54Cu_1xAg_x_35Y_11 0 < x 0.5 alloys by combining ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations with density functional theory
calculations. It is found that local structures defined by the common-neighbor
analysis and mechanical properties display a development as a function of
composition, and the calculated results with respect to the Ag composition is
well consistent with experiments. We show a strong interplay between local
structures and mechanical properties in that high icosahedral ordering and low
free volume are helpful to improve the strength, while the incorporation of
crystalline ordering and high free volume can initiate a better intrinsic
plasticity. Physical implications of these results are discussed and our
research is of great value to the development of multi-components amorphous
alloys.

Microstructure characterization and mechanical properties of TiB2/TiAl in situ
composite by induction skull melting process. Microstructures and mechanical
properties of Ti45Al2Nb1.5V1Mo0.3Y+3vol% TiB2 in situ composite fabricated by
induction skull melting ISM process were investigated. Results showed that ISM
process is feasible to fabricate high-quality in situ TiB2 /TiAl composite. The
composite exhibits much finer lamellar colony size and lamellar spacing,
compared with its TiAl base. Hexagonal primary and needlelike second TiB2
particles uniformly distribute mainly near lamellar colony boundaries with a few
inside lamellar colonies. TiB2 crystals in current TiAl composite exhibit
faceted growth mode along 0001 direction. The diverse morphologies of TiB2 are
principally ascribed to intrinsic crystal structure and different growth stages
during solidification. This composite exhibits much better tensile strength and
ductility than its TiAl matrix, with tensile strength UTS 610MPa and elongation
0.7% at room temperature, and UTS 505MPa and 12% at, respectively.

Texture, misorientation and mechanical anisotropy in a deformed dual phase
stainless steel weld joint. The deformation behavior of a duplex stainless steel
weld joint is studied. A detailed texture analysis shows that the increase of
the deformation percentage leads to a reinforcement of all possible {hkl}111 and
{hkl}100 components in austenite, and of the {hkl}110 components in ferrite for
both the base metal BM and the heat affected zone HAZ. In the weld metal WM, a
strong scatter of the crystallographic orientation relationship OR initially
found in the solidification microstructure is recorded after deformation. The
analysis of the Kernel Average Misorientation KAM distribution shows that the
deformation is more concentrated in the base metal than in the other parts of
the weld joint. The final mechanical behavior studied through microhardness
measurement and micromechanical calculations, allows us to separate the
contribution of both microstructural and textural evolution to the overall
strain hardening of the weld joint.

Biomaterials for Anticancer Drugs. Biomaterials for anticancer drug are an
important and essential topic in twenty-first-century medicine, because this
type of new materials overcomes the drawbacks of current chemotherapy technique
and greatly improve the quality of life of the patients. The major issue that
has faced in the past and current scenario is the less or non-bioavailability
and biodegradability of drug delivery even though they have high therapeutic
efficacy. To address this problem, recently most of the researchers were focused
to develop nanotechnology to solve the problems in drug delivery. This may
provide a better solution and thus changes the way we make drug and the way we
take drug. Therefore, in this chapter, we have discussed cancer, oral
chemotherapy and different biomaterials for anticancer drug and their advantage
over conventional anticancer drugs. This chapter will be a remarkable one for
understanding the usage of different type of biomaterials for the enhancement of

Electrophoretic deposition of ZnO/alginate and ZnO-bioactive glass/alginate
composite coatings for antimicrobial applications. Two organic/inorganic
composite coatings based on alginate, as organic matrix, and zinc oxide
nanoparticles n-ZnO with and without bioactive glass BG, as inorganic
components, intended for biomedical applications, were developed by
electrophoretic deposition EPD. Different n-ZnO1 -10 g/L and BG 1-1.5 g/L
contents were studied for a fixed alginate concentration 2 g/L. The presence of
n-ZnO was confirmed to impart antibacterial properties to the coatings against
gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, while the BG induced the formation of
hydroxyapatite on coating surfaces thereby imparting bioactivity, making the
coating suitable for bone replacement applications. Coating composition was
analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis TG, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy FTIR, X-ray diffraction XRD and energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy EDS analyses. Scanning electron microscopy SEM was employed to
study both the surface and the cross section morphology of the coatings.
Polarization curves of the coated substrates made in cell culture media at

Electron Paramagnetic Resonance in Hg1-xMnxTe1-ySey. Electron paramagnetic

Se y with y=0.01 and x=0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.14 and with y=0.075, x=0.14 in the

manganese concentration, and decreases with increasing selenium content. From
the high temperature linewidth dependence the paramagnetic Curie-Weiss
temperature is estimated as =10 K for the sample with x=0.01, y=0.01 and =18 K
for x=0.03, y=0.01. These values of 6 together with those obtained in the
magnetic susceptibility measurements give the nearest-neighbour exchange
constant in Hg1 -x Mn x Te1 -y Se y with y=0.01, J NN /k B =-5.4 K. The
calculated infinite temperature linewidths are considerably smaller than the
extrapolated experimental values. We ascribe this effect to a coalescence of the

Physicochemical fundamentals of modifying concrete mix and concrete. It is
possible to obtain highly efficient construction conglomerates by modifying the
structure of cement stone and concrete. Consequently, modification of the
concrete structure in this direction is intended to improve the technological
properties of the material. By modifying, it is possible to change the kinetics
of the growth of physical properties and the final values of the strength of
concrete. Without considering the physical and analytical mechanism for
modifying the structure formation of concrete, we note that it is primarily
aimed at reducing the amount of water -a mixture in a unit volume of material.
However, various studies have proved that in the initial period, the structure
formation of the cement stone develops in the optimal direction only at a
certain volumetric water content. The limiting reduction in water content makes
it difficult to hydrate the binder, limiting the final strength properties of
the material. At the same time, the final strength properties of the material
are improved with an all-round decrease in the volumetric water content of the
mixture. In all cases, the modification of concrete assumes its composition is
unchanged from the mixing of the mixture to the final stage of the formation of
the concrete structure. At present, only isolated attempts are known to
physically modify concrete, for example, during its evacuation. In this case,
the optimal amount of mixing water is introduced into the concrete mixture,
which ensures the optimal flow of the binder hydration reaction. The subsequent
suction of water, changing the initial composition of concrete, leads to a deep
modification of its structure formation. In particular, the density of the
material and its strength properties sharply increase. It should be noted that
physical modification of concrete leads to a change in the nature of fixation of
binder particles.

Experimental Investigation on Embedding Strength Perpendicular to Grain of
Parallel Strand Bamboo. Parallel strand bamboo PSB is a latest construction
material; to know more about mechanical properties of PSB, 5 groups of specimens
with difference only in bolt diameter were designed to study the impact of the
fastener diameter on embedding strength perpendicular to grain of PSB. Based on
the tested result, the feasibility for PSB of the theoretical equation in the
American code and European code on embedding strength predication was assessed.
A controlled displacement was used to load till specimen failure, the stress-
displacement curve of all specimens was obtained in terms of the tested results,
and the yielding tested strength based on 5% bolt diameter offset proposed by
the American code was found. The tested results showed that the yielding
strength perpendicular to grain of PSB was stable, the variable coefficient was
between 5.88% and 13.34%, and the average yielding strength values were 80.84
MPa, 77.40 MPa, 76.52 MPa, 74.20 MPa, and 67.01 MPa, respectively, which
decreased with the increase of bolt diameter, and the average yielding strength
values are larger than the calculated results using theoretical formula.
Therefore, the theoretical equation on embedding yielding strength of wood in
the American code and European code applies to PSB.

Space and time resolved electric field vector distribution in radiofrequency
discharges between unequal area electrodes. Two dimensional space and time-
resolved electric field vector distributions have been determined in asymmetric,
capacitively coupled, low frequency 35 kHz and radio-frequency 4 MHz discharges
in Ar/2.9%K mixtures. The electric field was measured using a non perturbative
spectroscopic technique based on the Stark mixing observed in the laser induced
fluorescence of NaK molecules. Sheath oscillations are clearly visible, and show
the different discharge conditions which prevail close to the different
electrodes. The field direction is almost stationary in time. The electric field
distribution is nearly radially uniform in front of the large electrode, while
geometrical effects seem to affect the discharge close to the small electrode.
Edge effects are visible at a distance of 2 mm from the electrode edges. In low
frequency discharges the ionic current is about the same at both electrodes,
whereas the current density is very different, due to the different charge
densities. In RF discharges conditions were found for which different discharge
sustaining regimes occur at each electrode: alpha regime near the large
electrode, gamma regime near the small electrode

Dependence of corrosion resistance on grain boundary characteristics in a high
nitrogen CrMn austenitic stainless steel. Processing schedules for grain
boundary engineering involving different types of cold deformation tension,
compression, and rolling and annealing were designed and carried out for
18Mn18Cr0.6N high nitrogen austenitic stainless steel. The grain boundary
characteristic distribution was obtained and characterized by electron
backscatter diffraction EBSD analysis. The corrosion resistance of the specimens
with different grain boundary characteristic distribution was examined by using
potentiodynamic polarization test. The corrosion behavior of different types of
boundaries after sensitization was also studied. The fraction of low- boundaries
decreased with increasing strain, and it was insensitive to the type of cold
deformation when the engineering strain was lower than 20%. At the strain of
30%, the largest and smallest fractions of low- boundaries were achieved in
cold-tensioned and rolled specimens, respectively. The fraction of low-
boundaries increased exponentially with the increase of grain size. The
proportion of low-angle grain boundaries increased with decreasing grain size.
Increasing the fraction of low- boundaries could improve the pitting corrosion
resistance for the steels with the same grain size. After sensitization, the
relative corrosion resistances of low-angle grain boundaries, 3 boundaries, and
9 boundaries were 100%, 95%, and 25%, respectively, while 27 boundaries, other
low- boundaries and random high-angle grain boundaries had no resistance to
corrosion.

Mild Steel Corrosion Mitigation in Sulphuric Acid via Benign Isolated
Phytochemicals from &lt;I&gt;Viscum album&lt;/I&gt;. We present the evaluation
of four Eco-friendly corrosion inhibitors for the corrosion mitigation of mild
steel in acid media. The corrosion inhibition of mild steel by ethanol extracts
from Viscum album EEVA and some of its isolated phytochemical components;
phytates extract PEVA, saponins extract SEVA, and flavonoids extracts FEVA have
been studied using gravi-metric and gasometric techniques. The results of the
study reveal that these ecofriendly and benign extracts function as good
inhibitors for mild steel corrosion in sulphuric acid. Inhibition efficiency of
the extracts increases with inhibitor concentration and temperature rise. The
trend of inhibition efficiency in lower inhibitor concentration is EEVA > PEVA >
SEVA > FEVA and at higher concentration, the order was SEVA > PEVA > EEVA >
FEVA. The presence of the plant extracts decreases the corrosion activation
energy in the solution which indicates chemical adsorption mechanism. The
adsorption of the components of the extracts is consistent with Temkin isotherm.
The interaction between the isolated extracts is synergistic at lower inhibitor
concentration and antagonistic at higher concentrations. The Kads values for
PEVA and SEVA are higher than those of EEVA and FEVA. This implies that PEVA and
SEVA are more efficiently adsorbed on the mild steel surface.

Texture induced plastic anisotropy of NiAl polycrystals. Textured stoichiometric
NiAl polycrystals have been deformed in compression at room temperature under
0.4 GPa confining pressure at a strain rate of about 10 4 s 1 . The strength of
the samples depends on the preferred orientation with respect to the compression
axis, with 100 being much harder than those with 110 and 111. Similarly, the
frequency of intercrystalline microcracking shows the same tendency. The
orientation distribution of the microcracks indicates that they mainly result
from internal stresses released after unloading. The plastic anisotropy at
elevated strains correlates with the Taylor energy calculated. The deviation
from axially symmetric deformation is due to the tendency of minimizing the
Taylor energy.

Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy to Study the Structural Relaxation
of PCFar Below the Glass Transition Temperature. We report the dynamics of the
physical aging of polycarbonate PC far below Tg by means of positron
annihilation lifetime spectroscopy PALS. This technique is able to detect the
isothermal relaxation of the free volume after rejuvenation above Tg. The
isothermal relaxation was done at different temperatures far below Tg and for
different aging times. The free volume relaxation results were modeled according
to a phenomenological model presented by Struik, so as to obtain the equilibrium
relaxation times of the aging process at each aging temperature. The results
suggest two possible scenarios for aging far below Tg:the relaxation process of
PC is dominated by the process, although the fast modes of theprocess remain
present even at the lowest investigated temperature;an Arrhenius type process,
resulting from cooperative dynamics of several processes, determines the aging
far below Tg.

Electrochemical characterization of ZnO-based transparent materials as recording
electrodes for neural probes in optogenetics. In the elucidation of brain
functions, neuroscience has garnered attention in the realization of brain-
machine interfaces, deep brain stimulation, and artificial intelligence.
Optogenetics is a biological technique used to control neural activities via
optical stimulation. It is one of the most effective approaches used to
investigate brain functions. This study proposed to employ the transparent
recording electrode to enhance the performance of neural probes for
optogenetics. Compared with conventional metal recording electrodes, the
proposed transparent recording electrodes have the potential to obtain higher
signal-to-noise ratios when placed over optical stimulation points. To develop
transparent recording electrodes, we used ZnO-based materials with good
biocompatibility and transparency for utilization as biomedical electrodes.
Considering saline as one of the main components of living organisms, we
investigated the fundamental electrochemical characteristics of ZnO-based
electrodes in saline through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic
voltammetry. The results showed that nondoped ZnO and Al-doped ZnO, deposited by
radio frequency magnetron sputtering, exhibited a broad potential window. An
electrical double layer was found to strongly act on the interface between the
electrodes and solution rather than a redox reaction. In addition, this study
reports the effects of crystallization and dopant on the electrochemical
characteristics of the ZnO-based electrodes. The transparent ZnO-based electrode
developed herein is a promising candidate to enhance the performance of neural
probes for optogenetics and can be effectively applied in biological devices.

Electromagnetic interference shielding behavior of hybrid carbon
nanotube/exfoliated graphite nanoplatelet coated glass fiber composites. We
investigated the tailored electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness
EMI SE of polyester-matrix composites consisting of glass fiber textiles coated
with multiwalled carbon nanotubesand exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets xGnPs.
The effects of various combinations of material parameters, including MWCNT
length, xGnP size, MWCNT:xGnP weight ratio, host-substrate surface configuration
of carbon nanomaterials and their amount coated per unit area, on the EMI SE
were studied. The shielding mechanisms, namely, absorption, reflection, and
multiple reflections, are discussed based on the underlying governing physics.
EMI SE measurements showed that coating glass fibers with hybrid MWCNTs/xGnPs at
8/2/ ratio yields EMIhigher than those of composites containing the same content
of a single-type of CNM, ranging from 56.8dB at 30MHz to 35.3dB at 1.5GHz.
Morphological studies showed that, upon placement on glass fiber surfaces, 1D
fiber-likeserve as interconnects that bridge the randomly oriented 2D platelet-
like xGnPs to form an efficient plane shield of electromagnetic waves.

On the Rotating Bending Fatigue of Steel Specimens with Two Holes and Over. We
carried on the rotating bending fatigue test of steel specimens with two holes
and over. Specimens tested have radial holes drilled under the different
conditions reciprocally, in parts of A and B types. Every specimen of A type has
each hole axis on the same longitudinal section. Every specimen of B type has
each hole axis on the same cross section. We investigated the effects that the
conditions of drilled holes and the interference of mutual holes had on the
fatigue strength. The results obtained are as follow;1 In A type, the fatigue
limits are raised slowly with the increase of the number of holes up to six
holes in each pitch of holes 2mm, because of stress relaxation caused by the
interference of mutual holes.2 In the hole pitches of 2mm and of 6mm, the
fatigue limit for 2mm is higher than that for a single hole, but the fatigue
limit for 6mm comes almost to the same value as that for a single hole. In the
pitch of 6mm, the stress relaxation is not caused by the mutual holes.3 InB
type, the fatigue limits are reduced with the increase of maximum stress caused
at holes under repeated load. In the same value of maximum stress, the time
strengths by overstress are reduced with the increase of the number of holes.4
In comparison of the mechanical properties of various specimens subjected to
repeated load and those of each virgin specimens, we obtained the effects of
conditions of drilled holes upon the degree of fatigue progress.

Effects of Cr addition on Charpy impact energy in austenitic-24Mn-0,3,6Cr
steels. Effects of Cr addition 0, 3, and 6 wt% on Charpy impact properties of
FeCMnCr-based steels were studied by conducting dynamic compression tests at
room and cryogenic temperatures. At room temperature, deformation mechanisms of
Charpy impacted specimens were observed as twinning induced plasticity TWIP
without any transformation induced plasticity TRIP in all the steels. At
cryogenic temperature, many twins were populated in the Cr-added steels, but,
interestingly, fine -martensite was found in ther steel, satisfying the Shoji-
Nishiyama SN orientation relationship, { 111 } //{ 0002 } and < 101 > //< 11 2 0

steel were situated in the TWIP regime, the martensitic transformation was
induced by Mn- and Cr-segregated bands. In ther steel,of low-Mn,Cr bands lay
between the TWIP and TRIP regimes which were sensitively affected by a small
change of SFE. The dynamic compressive test results well showed the relation
between segregation bands and the Effects of Cr were known as not only
increasing the SFE but also promoting the carbide precipitation. In order to

Rational design and evaluation of UV curable nano-silver ink applied in highly
conductive textile-based electrodes and flexible silver-zinc batteries. A novel
UV curable nano-silver ink with low-temperature and short-time curing features
was developed for the application of high-performance e-textiles. By
investigating the influence of ink composition, it can provide a guideline to
the ink formulation design and understand the mechanism of printing defect
formation. The electrical conductivity of textile-based electrode was achieved
as high as 2.47 106 S/m when the nano-silver content of conductive ink was 60
wt%. The textile-based electrode showed outstanding mechanical durability and
could maintain resistance stability within 10 washing and drying cycles. The
application potential of conductive ink in fabricating e-textiles was confirmed
by using the textile-based electrode as the cathode of silver-zinc battery. The
possibility of printing conductive ink on textiles is progressively researched
due to its potential benefits in manufacturing functional wearable electronics
and improving wearing comfort. However, few studies have reported the effect of
conductive ink formulation on electrodes directly screen-printed on flexible
substrates, especially printing UV curable conductive ink on common textiles. In
this work, a novel UV curable nano-silver ink with short-time curing and low
temperature features was developed to manufacture the fully flexible and
washable textile-based electrodes by screen printing. The aim of this study was
to determine the influence of ink formulation on UV-curing speed, degree of
conversion, morphology and electrical properties of printed electrodes. Besides,
the application demonstration was highlighted. The curing speed and adhesion of
ink was found depending dominantly on the type of prepolymer and the
functionality of monomer, and the type of photoinitiator had a decisive effect
on the curing speed, degree of double bond conversion and morphology of printed
patterns. The nano-silver content is key to guarantee the suitable screen-
printability of conductive ink and therefore the uniformity and high
conductivity of textile-based electrodes. Optimally, an ink formulation with 60
wt% nano-silver meets the potential application requirements. The electrode with
1.0 mm width showed significantly high electrical conductivity of 2.47 10 6 S/m,
outstanding mechanical durability and satisfactory washability. The high-
performance of electrodes screen-printed on different fabrics proved the
feasibility and utility of UV curable nano-silver ink. In addition, the
application potential of the conductive ink in fabricating electronic textiles
e-textiles was confirmed by using the textile-based electrodes as the cathodes
of silver-zinc batteries. We anticipate the developed UV curable conductive ink
for screen-printing on textiles can provide a novel design opportunity for
flexible and wearable e-textile applications.

Ozone priming of patterned carbon nanotube forests for subsequent atomic layer
deposition-like deposition of SiO2 for the preparation of microfabricated thin
layer chromatography plates. The authors report the ozonation of patterned,
vertically aligned carbon nanotube CNT forests as a method of priming them for
subsequent pseudo atomic layer deposition -ALD alternating layer deposition of
silica to produce microfabricated, CNT-templated thin layer chromatography TLC
plates. Gas phase ozonation simplifies our deposition scheme by replacing two
steps in our previous fabrication process: chemical vapor deposition of carbon
and ALD of Al2O3, with this much more straightforward priming step.shown by
x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS, ozonation appears to prime/increase the
number of nucleation sites on theby oxidizing them, thereby facilitating
conformal growth of silica by -ALD, where some form of priming appears to be
necessary for this growth.shown previously, -ALD of SiO2 onto unprimedis
ineffective and leads to poor quality depositions. In conjunction with a
discussion of the challenges of good peak fitting of complex C1 s XPS narrow
scans, the authors present an analysis of their C1 s data that suggests an
increase in oxidized carbon, particularly the C=O group, with increasing oxygen
content of the CNT forests. After coating with SiO2, theare removed by elevated
temperature air oxidation, the SiO2 is rehydrated, and the plates are coated
with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane APTES. The resulting APTES-coated plates
separate various fluorescent dyes giving results that are generally at least as
good as those the authors reported previously with their more complicated
fabrication/priming scheme. TLC plates with different geometries are
microfabricated, where plates with narrower channels show longer run times lower
mobile phase velocities and plates with narrower features appear to give higher
efficiencies.

EPR Identification of Defects and Impurities in SiC: To be Decisive. In EPR
electron paramagnetic resonance identification of point defects, hyperfine HF
interaction is decisive information not only for chemical identity but also for
the local geometry and the electronic state. In some intrinsic defects in SiC,
the wave function of the unpaired electron extends quite unevenly among major
atoms comprising the defects. In such a case, the determination of the number of
equivalent atoms and the chemical identity Si or C of those atoms even with weak
HF splitting are useful to compare with HF parameters obtained theoretically.
For vacancy-related defects of relatively deep levels, the sum of the spin
densities on the nearest-neighbor shell is found to be 60-68%.

On incipient plasticity in the vicinity of grain boundaries in aluminum
bicrystals: Experimental and simulation nanoindentation study. The local
mechanical behavior near <100> symmetric tilt grain boundaries in aluminum
bicrystals were studied by the nanoindentation technique as well as by computer
simulations. Experimentally, grain boundaries with misorientation angles 8.7,
13.8 and 18.8 were examined. Two well pronounced pop-in events were observed on
the load penetration depth curves measured during indentation in the close
vicinity of the studied boundaries. The load of the pop-ins, observed close to
the boundaries, practically did not differ from that obtained in the grain
interior. This was interpreted as evidence that the boundaries with
misorientations in the examined angular range do not represent specific sites
for sources of lattice dislocations. The load, at which the second pop-ins took
place, substantially increased with increasing misorientation angle of the
examined boundaries. Quasistatic molecular dynamics simulations were performed
to identify the details of the interaction between grain boundary and
dislocations generated during indentation. For this purpose, the bicrystals with
similar geometry and misorientation angles, as investigated experimentally, were
computed. The simulation results showed that the direct transmission of incoming
dislocations across the grain boundary was the primary mechanism for the plastic
flow transfer past the boundary. The analysis of the results of both experiments
and simulations provided evidence that the capability of grain boundaries to act
as a barrier for the motion of incoming dislocations depends crucially on grain
boundary structure.

Si beam-assisted graphitization of SiC0001 . We have performed a study of
thermal graphitization of SiC0001 surface in the high-purity molecular beam of
Si atoms obtained from a controllable source. With the aid of Si beam, we have
been able to achieve the semi-equilibrium reaction conditions and to control the
growth rate of graphene film freely until complete stop of the graphitization,
at the test temperature of. Samples treated in Si beam are characterized by
larger and homogeneous areas of graphene having uniform thickness, and much
improved crystallographic ordering. This is attributed mainly to the improved
buffer layer structure. The buffer layer shows neither disordered regions, nor
point defects, which are prevalent in UHV-annealed samples. Significantly
smaller concentrations of other surface defects are also observed. The used
approach is a promising alternative to more commonly used buffer gas
graphitization methods. Apart from the precise control for process parameters
and very high process purity, it also allows for a co-deposition of other atoms
at the growth stage.

Potability of Groundwater in Itu Local Government Area, South-South of Nigeria.
Water samples were obtained from eight 8 different boreholes in Itu local
government area, South-South of Nigeria. These samples were treated and analyzed
using standard methods for their pH, temperature, turbidity, electrical
conductivity EC, total hardness TH, dissolved oxygen DO, biochemical oxygen
demand BOD, iron Fe, zinc Zn, copper Cu, lead Pb, cadmium Cd and nickel Ni
levels. Mean levels of all the parameters determined in studied groundwater were
within their safe limits except lead and cadmium. This study revealed that
concentrations of Pb and Cd rendered water from the studied boreholes unsafe for
human consumption considering the toxic nature of these metals. Variable
correlations were observed among the studied physicochemical properties of
water. Pollution index analysis also confirmed the hazardous nature of lead and
cadmium in groundwater from studied boreholes. Proper treatment of studied
boreholes to eliminate these toxic metals has been recommended as prolong
consumption of this untreated water may eventually result in health problems
associated with pb and Cd toxicities.

x-ray radiation from a tungsten tube is collimated by pinhole diaphragms of 100

mechanically scanned with a computer-controlled x-y stage under the stationary
primary beam, and from each sampling grid point the diffracted intensities are
acquired with an energy dispersive spectrometer system.a result of residual
lattice strain in the probed volume the diffracted beams are shifted as well as
broadened on the energy scale. Line-profile analysis by Gauss peak modeling has
been performed to determine the widths and positions of the diffraction peaks.
The results are distribution maps of residual strain for selected hkl
reflections, in addition to crystal texture maps. With this preliminary setup
relative lattice compressions and expansions down to about 4.10 -4 can be
resolved with a spatial resolution of 0.1 mm. An illustrative example is
provided by residual strain maps as well as crystal texture maps of a rivet made

Validation of Material Parameters of Collagen Compositions for the Application
as a Bioink. The novel approach of an individualized medicine affects nowadays
various areas of therapeutic treatment. Primarily, these include the application
of pharmaceuticals, private point-of-care solutions, surgical procedures as well
as steps of rehabilitation. However, beside these existing strategies the
development of patient specific models for the training of clinical personal is
currently insufficient. Such models are essential to prepare a personalized
approach of medical care. One possible solution to address this problem could be
the adaption of the established 3d printing technology for the processing of
suitable biopolymers. The presented work is focused on the development of a
printing system utilizing collagen. Therefore, it is intended to design multiple
extrusion heads in accordance with the material parameters. In order to achieve
the aspired physiological properties of the final model, a first set of
experiments will be performed with several compositions of collagen to validate
the fundamental mechanical characteristics. Hereby, the elasticity, thermal
stability, force resistance as well as the haptic behaviour are of most
interest. Afterwards, these obtained experimental results should be used to
simulate the extrusion process and to validate the extruder concepts. In case of
a positive evaluation these concepts are realized by using rapid prototyping
technologies. Finally, this novel 3d printer will be used to print first organic
test structures with collagen.

Microstructure and oxidation behaviour of chromiummolybdenum silicides. In the
present study the results regarding a microstructural investigation carried out
on mixed CrMo silicide alloys are presented. A powder metallurgy route was
adopted for the preparation of the specimens. The green compacts obtained from
powder mixtures were hot-pressed at for several hours. Two batches were
prepared, in one of which 15 vol.% of Pt6%Rh fibres were introduced. The
majority phases present in the materials are: Cr3Si and Cr5Si3 with molybdenum
in solution. Scanning electron microscopy observations were carried out in order
to better characterise the microstructure of the alloys. Isothermal oxidation
treatments were conducted on metallographically polished alloy coupons. The
treatments were carried out in air at temperatures ranging from 900 up to. The
oxide scales were examined with X-ray diffractometry and electron microscopy to
obtain information on the oxidation mechanisms. At all the analysed samples
revealed excellent oxidation resistance determined by the formation of a
continuous protective Cr2O3 surface layer. AtCr2O3 is still the main oxide phase
in the scale even though, particularly for the specimen without Pt fibres, it
starts to be destabilised with the formation of the volatile CrO3 phase. At some
cristobalite is also present in the oxide scale. The oxidation kinetics are
largely dominated by the formation of CrO3 .

Effects of alloying elements and annealing treatment on the microstructure and
mechanical properties of NbTaTi alloys fabricated by partial diffusion for
biomedical applications. Powder metallurgical PM Nb-25Ta-xTi alloys x = 5, 15,
25, 35 at.% were fabricated by the elemental powder sintering technology.
Effects of alloying elements and annealing treatment on the microstructural
evolution and mechanical properties were investigated by conducting various
tests, including X-ray diffraction XRD, scanning electron microscopy SEM,
electron probe microanalyses EPMA, electron back scattered diffraction detector
EBSD, transmission electron microscopy TEM and tensile tests. The results
indicated that the alloys showed a unique Nb-rich and Ta-rich dual structure due
to the insufficient diffusion between powders. With the increase of Ti content,
the phase was always retained and the alloys exhibited a relatively high density
in the range of 82.4% to 90.5%. Furthermore, owing to a higher diffusion
coefficient of Ti and the strengthening effect of solid solution, the volume
shrinkage and tensile strength both increased along with the increase of Ti
content. After the annealing treatment was introduced, the microstructure became
more homogeneous and fine equiaxed grains appeared, which induced a decrease in
modulus and better ductility. The Nb-25Ta-25Ti alloys exhibited a good in vitro
biocompatibility due to the chemical components and the introduce of surface
pores. The PM NbTaTi alloys were promising for biomedical applications in tissue
engineering after evaluated both mechanical properties and in vitro
biocompatibility. Nb-25Ta-xTi alloys with a dual structure were fabricated by
partial diffusion. Effect of alloying elements on microstructure and mechanical
properties of NbTaTi alloys was investigated. Effect of annealing treatment on
microstructure and mechanical properties of NbTaTi alloys was investigated.
NbTaTi alloys are promising as a new candidate of biomedical application.

Empirical Modelling of Nonmonotonous Behaviour of Shear Viscosity. Almost all
hitherto proposed empirical models used for characterization of shear viscosity
of non-Newtonian liquids describe only its monotonous course. However, the onset
of new materials is accompanied by more complicated characteristics of their
behaviour including nonmonotonous course of shear viscosity. This feature is
reflected not only in an existence of one extreme point maximum or minimum, but
also it can appear in both extreme points; that is, this shear viscosity
initially exhibits shear thinning; after attaining a local minimum, it converts
to shear thickening, and again after reaching a local maximum, it has a shear-
thinning character. It is clear that, for an empirical description of this
complex behaviour, a hitherto, used number of parameters four, five in classical
monotonous models such as Cross or Carreau-Yasuda are no longer tenable. If more
parameters are applied, there should be given an emphasis on a relatively simple
algebraic form of the proposed models, unambiguity of the involved parameters,
and their sound interpretation in the whole modelling. This contribution
provides an overview of the existing empirical nonmonotonous models and proposes
a new 10-parameter model including a demonstration of its flexibility using
various experimental data.

layers of EuS form electron barriers for both electrons and holes in nonmagnetic
quantum wells of PbS. PL was observed in the near infrared due to electronic
transitions in PbS quantum wells with narrow energy gaps. Measurements carried
out at 4.2 and i.e., below and above the Curie temperature of EuS layers, which
is about showed characteristic PL spectra consisting of one or two lines with a
strongly non-linear response upon increasing the YAG laser excitation power.
Below the Curie temperature, the application of a weak magnetic field of 200 Oe
results in a change of the PL intensity as well as a small red shift in the PL
energy of about 1 meV. These observations are discussed in terms of the model
taking into account the magnetization-dependent height of the EuS potential
barrier for electrons in a PbS quantum well.

Thermal behaviour of mechanically alloyed Ni50Mo50 powders and associated
kinetics of amorphous phase transformation. The thermal behaviour of powders
obtained by mechanically alloying elemental crystalline nickel and molybdenum
powders for various times was investigated using differential scanning
calorimetry DSC and linked to structural data obtained by X-ray diffraction. The
two observed exothermic heat effects were correlated with the milling time. The
heat of relaxation reached a value of about 8.5 kJ mol1 after 100 h of milling
and slowly increased as the fraction of amorphous phase increased. The heat of
crystallization reached a maximum value close to 5 kJ mol1 after 300 h of
milling and then slowly decreased. The formation of the amorphous phase by
mechanical alloying occurred in three distinct stages: 1 the formation of very
fine composite powders, 2 the nucleation and rapid growth of the amorphous
phase, and 3 a steady-state reaction governed by the gradual dissolution of
molybdenum crystallites into the amorphous matrix. The kinetic parameters for
the transformation of the amorphous phase were derived from isothermal DSC.
These parameters depend on the milling time. For the later stage of the
mechanical alloying process, two-step crystallization was found. The
compositionally dependent amorphous phase seems to be the factor most
responsible for the changes in transformation kinetics.

Magnetic ordering and spin fluctuations in nearly half-doped manganites. We
discuss unusual behavior discovered in spin dynamics in the nearly half-doped
manganite systems. Nd0.45Sr0.55MnO3 is a metallic antiferromagnet, and exhibits
very anisotropic spin wave dispersion relations. The ferromagnetic FM state of
Pr1 /2 Sr1 /2 MnO3 and Nd1 /2 Sr1 /2 MnO3 also exhibit clear anisotropic
dispersion relations. Such anisotropy reflects the underlying dx 2 y 2 -type
orbital ordering. We also demonstrate that the high temperature paramagnetic
state without charge ordering in doped manganites is characterized by the FM
spin fluctuations with an anomalously small energy scale for a wide range of
doping concentrations.

Effects of the annealing temperature on the structure and up-conversion
photoluminescence of ZnO film. The up-conversion film is being tried to increase
the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the silicon solar cell. To improve
the efficiency of the photoluminescence film, the effects of the annealing
temperature were investigated on the structure and photoluminescence of the ZnO
up-conversion film, which was prepared using the sol-gel method and the spin-
coating technique. The results show that the organic compounds and water in the
ZnO film were completely eliminated when the annealing temperature reached. The
crystallinity of film is improved and the average grain size continuously
increases as increasing the annealing temperature. The transmittance in the
wavelength range of 4002000nm continuously increases as the annealing
temperature increases from to, whilst it decreases first and then increases as
the annealing temperature increases from to. When the film is excited with a
laser of 980nm, there are two intense emission bands in the up-conversion
emission spectra, 542-nm green light and 660-nm red light, corresponding to
Ho3+: 5S2/5F45I8and 5F55I8 transitions, respectively. In addition, the intensity
of up-conversion luminescence for the film increases first and then decreases
with the increase of the annealing temperature. When the annealing temperature
is at, the film consists of small round compact particles with a high degree of
crystallization, reaching maximum up-conversion intensity of the film.

Enhanced mechanical properties and biocompatibility of novel
hydroxyapatite/TOPAS hybrid composite for bone tissue engineering applications.
The bioactivity and mechanical properties of hybrid composites of hydroxyapatite
HA in cyclic olefinic copolymer COC also known commercially as TOPAS are
investigated, first time, for regeneration and repair of the bone tissues. HA is
synthesized to obtain the spherically shaped nanoparticles in the size range of
6020nm. Various concentrations of HA ranging from 1 to 30wt% are dispersed in
TOPAS using sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS coupling agent for better dispersion and
interaction of hydrophilic HA with hydrophobic TOPAS. Scanning electron
microscope shows the uniform dispersion of HA10wt% in TOPAS and at higher
concentrations >10wt%, agglomeration occurs in the hybrid composites. Tunable
mechanical properties are achieved as the compressive modulus and strength are
increased around 140% from 6.4 to 15.3MPa and 185% from 0.26 to 0.74MPa,
respectively. Such increase in the mechanical properties of TOPAS is attributed
to the anchoring of the polymer chains in the vicinity of HA nanoparticles owing
to better dispersion and interfacial interactions. In comparison to neat TOPAS,
hybrid composites of TOPAS/HA promoted the cell adhesion and proliferation
significantly. The cell density and proliferation of TOPAS/HA hybrid composites
is enhanced 9 and 3 folds, respectively, after 1day culturing in preosteoblasts
cells. Moreover, the morphology of cells changed from spherical to flattened
spread morphology demonstrating clearly the migration of the cells for the
formation of interconnected cellular network. Additionally, very few dead cells
are found in hybrid composites showing their cytocompatibility. Overall, the
hybrid composites of TOPAS/HA exhibited superior strength and stiffness along
with enhanced cytocompatibility for bone tissue engineering applications.

creep tests under X-ray synchrotron radiation. The magnitude of the effective
lattice mismatch in the to 1000 C to temperature range always increased after
overheatings performed at temperatures lower than 1130 C. In contrast, a
decrease of its magnitude was observed after overheatings at temperatures
greater than 1180 C due to massive dislocation recovery processes occurring at

Visible-light-induced photo-Fenton degradation of rhodamine B over
Fe2O3-diatomite materials. Diatomite is mined in Phu Yen province, Vietnam and
the Fe2O3-diatomite materials are synthesized by a simple process for the photo-
Fenton reaction of rhodamine BRhB degradation. The pure diatomite and
Fe2O3-diatomite materials have large pore structures representing the high
adsorption ability and efficient photocatalysis. Characterizations of diatomite-
Fe2O3 materials were determined by X-ray diffraction XRD, FT-IR analysis, field
emission scanning electron microscopy FE-SEM images, dynamic light scattering
DLS, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ICP-MS analysis. The
catalytic activity of the Fe2O3-diatomite materials was evaluated by the
degradation of the RhB dye under visible light irradiation in the effect of
hydrogen peroxide H2O2. The results show that the 3% Fe2O3-diatomite sample has
the highest RhB photocatalytic degradation efficiency with approximately 81% for
150minutes under visible light. This value is 2 times higher than the
degradation efficiency of the pure diatomite. In addition, the Fe2O3-diatomite
photocatalysts are indicated as potential materials for photo-Fenton degradation
of organic contaminants due to their highly stable abilities.

The effect of vacancy defects on the electronic properties of -Ga2O3. In this
paper, the characteristics of oxygen vacancies VO and gallium vacancies VGa in
-Ga2O3 are studied using density functional theory. The performed relaxation
analysis indicates that the relaxation of VGa increases its octahedral volume.
Compared with the tetrahedron, the Ga atom of the octahedron surrounding VO is
more stable. The formation energy results suggest also that VGa0 is expected to
be most favorable in p-type -Ga2O3 , while VGa -3 is preferred in the n -type.
The 3 charge state acts as a compensating acceptor, which reduces electron
conductivity. VO +2 , which acts as the compensation donor center, can easily
form in p-type -Ga2O3 , while the VO0 forms readily in n -type -Ga2O3 . VGa at
high density can exist in -Ga2O3 in an oxygen-rich environment, while VO can
exist under oxygen-poor conditions. The defect charge-state transition level
reveals that VGa is a deep acceptor and VO is a deep donor. For VGa , the
transition levels 0/-1, -2/-1, and -3/-2 can appear in the thermodynamic
equilibrium system. However, for VO and VOIII , which are used as negative-U
centers, only the transition level 2+/0/ can appear in thermodynamic
equilibrium. Furthermore, the calculated bandgap properties indicate that VGa is
capable of introducing ferromagnetism in -Ga2O3 , while VO cannot. VGa
introduces both acceptor levels and donor levels within the bandgap, which
compensate each other, and they, thus, determine the acceptor characteristics of
the system. The appearance of VO -introduced donor levels into the bandgap
increases the overall electron concentration of the system. A Bader charge
analysis shows that the vacancy defect can have a strong effect on the charge
distribution of the crystal and alter the electronic characteristics of the
crystal. The research results in this paper show that the electronic and
magnetic properties of -Ga2O3 can be changed significantly by introducing
different types of vacancy defects with different charge states during the
preparation process of the device. This can be done to meet specific performance
requirements of a commercial electronic component.

Effect of Humidity on Fatigue Strength of Maraging Steel with Different
Hardness. In order to investigate the effect of humidity on initiation and
propagation properties of a fatigue crack of 18%Ni maraging steels with
different grain size and hardness, rotating bending fatigue tests were carried
out in relative humidity of 25% and 85%. Fatigue strength was largely decreased
by high humidity and the decrease in fatigue strength due to high humidity was
increased with increases in grain size and specimen hardness. In high humidity,
both of initiation and propagation of a crack were accelerated. The acceleration
of a crack growth was caused by intergranular crack. Although the proportional
relation between fatigue limit and hardness held up to HV600 in high humidity of
85%, the limiting hardness in the relation increased to HV750 in low humidity of
25%. The decrease in fatigue strength due to high humidity was suppressed by
double aging, which was aged at fors after aging at for 150ks.

work explored the synthesis and characterization of magnetic manganese ferrites
using a simple combustion method. The purpose of creating the magnetic manganese
ferrites was for their planned use as ozonation catalysts. Their magnetic
properties allow for their recovery from the treatment system. Magnetic
manganese ferrites were prepared by mixing manganese nitrate and iron nitrate in
a stoichiometric ratio of 1:2. Polyvinyl alcohol was added to the mixed metal
salt solution and the ratio of PVA: total nitrate salt added was varied from 1:1
up to 1:2 by weight. The resulting particles were characterized by X-ray

Structural, optical and ac conduction properties of Bi2V1xNbxO5.5 0x0.4 thin

Pt/TiO2 /SiO2 /Si and Corning glass substrates and investigated systematically
for their microstructural, optical and ac conduction properties. The undoped
bismuth vanadate, Bi2VO5.5BVO thin films were highly textured and have been
associated with the c -axis oriented grains of the layered perovskite structure,
while the Nb doped films consisted of randomly oriented crystallites. The
scanning electron microscopy of the films indicates that the grain size
increases with increase in Nb content. The optical transmission studies carried
out on the samples deposited on Corning glass substrates revealed that these
films were nearly 80% transparent in the 400900nm range and the band gap of Nb
doped BVO thin films was slightly higher 3.13eV for x =0.4 than that of the
undoped 2.91eV films. The dielectric constant of the Nb doped films increased
with increase in Nb content, while the dielectric loss decreased especially in
the 3100kHz frequency range. At a particular frequency, the conductivity
decreased with increase in Nb content in the BVN thin films. In the higher
temperature range, the activation energy varied from 0.61eV x =0.1 to 0.76eV x

conduction properties of these films suggests the conduction process in these

Fatigue characteristics of 0.2%C carbon steel specimens with case hardened
notches by laser quenching.. Although some case hardening methods, e.g. high
frequency induction quenching, cementation and nitriding, are being applied to
increase the fatigue strength of carbon steels, these methods require a
troublesome treatment. Laser case hardening method has been developed to avoid
the trouble and to increase hardness at a small desired area.The present study
was planned to investigate the effect of laser case hardening on fatigue
strength by using 0.2%C carbon steel specimens with five different types of U
and V notches and by applying laser case hardening treatment on the notch part
of each specimen. Since it is well known that the fatigue strength in impact
fatigue is lower than that in non-impact fatigue, most of the experiments were
conducted under impact fatigue load conditions in the wide stress cycles range
ofcycles.The SN curves under the non-impact load condition and those of the
annealed specimens under the impact and non-impact load conditions were also
obtained, and the effect of case hardening by laser surface quenching on fatigue
strength were discussed by comparing these SN curves each other, especially from
the viewpoint of dependence of strength increase by laser case hardening on the
stress concentration factor.The results showed that the laser case hardening
method was effective to increase the fatigue strength of notched specimens whose
stress concentration factor is in the range of <4. In other words, an increase
in fatigue life of structual elements can be expected sufficiently by applying
this method at locations considered as the initiating part of fatigue failure,
because the stress concentration factor scarcely exceeds the value of 4 in
service structural elements.

Stickiness of Oils and Fats. The stickiness between a stainless steel plate and
several kinds of hydrogenated oils and their mixtures for margarine was measured
by the use of an improved high sensitive stickiness meter.On the range between
10g/cm2 and 50g/cm2 of compressive stress, the rate of separation of the plate
does not affect the stickiness of hydrogenated cotton seed oil, but the
stickiness of mixing oil for margarine increases up to 60% at the rate of
5mm/min. It is noticeable that the values of the hesion force of oils and fats
are somewhat scattered in the range of separation rate between 0.5 and
50mm/min.The hesion force of hydrogenated oil increases in general with
temperature, but margarine oil of soft type decreases remarkably its hesion
force with temperature over. Between the peeling time tb and the hesion force
fb, Eley's relation tb fb-n, is established the n of oils and fats being in the
range from 1 to 3.The solid fat content of oils and fats is an important
characteristic in connection with the variability of the hesion force.Under the
standardized conditions of the two peeling rates, 1mm/min and 5mm/min, the
maximum peak of hesion force was found at solid fat content of about 22%. It
will be concluded, therefore, that the adhesive force to steel reaches an
equilibrium with the cohesive force of oils due to their structural
characteristics.

film quality like surface quality and crystal quality,and growth rate was
studied under the plasma theory.At different currents,with the macroparticles
filtered,the macroparticle sizes were almost constant and the film surface was
very smooth.With 200 preferred orientation and fine crystallization as well as
tight cohesion between film and substrate,the growth rate for the wear-resistant
TiN films was the highest at the magnetic filtering current of 4.0 A.This
quality characteristic of TiN films at the current of 4.0 A is induced by the
high energy and density of plasma,and the substrate being placed at the center

Transformation lines in an Fe-based shape memory alloy under tensile and
compressive stress states. Uniaxial transformation/deformation behavior of an
Fe-based shape memory alloy is investigated under tensile and compressive stress
state through the transformation start/finish conditions, which can be drawn as
the straight lines on the stresstemperature plane. The martensite start stresses
in tension and compression form the straight lines, which are, however, not
symmetric with respect to the stress. In both tension and compression, and
austenite start and finish lines shift from an initial austenite line to the
lower temperature side and the higher temperature side, respectively, meaning
the reverse transformation zone becomes wider, as the extent of prior
martensitic transformation increases. The slope of the austenite lines does not
change in this process. The austenite start/finish lines in tension are extended
to the compression side without change in slope. The same is true for the
austenite start/finish lines in compression. The uniaxial thermomechanical
hystereses, the stressstraintemperature loops can be well explained by means of
the transformation lines determined.

charge density of epitaxial graphene via a gate voltage while leaving the
surface open for further manipulation or investigation. Depending on the doping

A model is proposed, which quantitatively describes the gate operation. The
model is verified by a control experiment with an illuminated gate structure

Slag Flow in the Packed Bed With Varied Properties and Bed Conditions: Numerical
Investigation. Molten slag, which is primarily generated in the blast furnace BF
cohesive zone, trickles down through the coke packed bed in the form of films,
rivulets, or droplets in the lower zone of the BF. During its downward flow,
there are significant interactions occurring between slag and other phases such
as gas, coke particles, hot metal, and fine powders. In terms of these
interactions, slag flow behavior can greatly affect BF productivity and be
associated with furnace irregularities such as channeling, hanging, and
slipping. Hence, understanding the interactions between phases is useful to
maximizing BF efficiency in terms of operating cost, reliability, and production
capacity. In the current study, a Volume of Fluid VOF modeling technique was
applied to track the movement of individual slag droplets in the packed bed at a
mesoscopic level, considering various bed permeabilities, more wide-ranging slag
properties, and different wettability between slag and packing particles.
Results demonstrate the significant role of modeling at a mesoscopic level in
understanding macroscopic slag flow behavior. Modeling work helps to visualize
the trickling behavior of slag droplets in more realistic and complex conditions
representing a BF, and clarify the mechanisms of the different flow patterns
generated for variations in operating conditions. Transient flow characteristics
such as localized slag accumulation and droplet morphology were identified and
analyzed in relation to complex condition changes. The current modeling proved
to be a valuable tool to provide a foundation for better understanding the slag
flow behavior and its interactions with other phases in the BF lower zone.

One-pot green synthesis of doxorubicin loaded-silica nanoparticles for in vivo
cancer therapy. The present work reveals a new and simple one-pot green method
to load doxorubicin DOX drugs in silica nanoparticles for efficient in vivo
cancer therapy. The synthesis of DOX loaded silica nanoparticles SiNPs/DOX is
based on the efficient encapsulation of DOX in surfactant Tween 80 micelles
which act as a template for the formation of silica nanoparticles. The release
profile, cellular uptake behavior, cytotoxicity and antitumor effect of
SiNPs/DOX nanoparticles were investigated and compared to free DOX. The silica
nanoparticles improved the cellular drug delivery efficiency and exhibited high
cytotoxicity, successfully achieving the inhibition of tumor growth. Notably,
the tumor size and weight of SiNPs/DOX group was 2-fold and 1.7-fold smaller
than that of free DOX group, and 4-fold and 2-fold smaller than that of PBS
group. The one-pot green synthesis system may have the potential to be developed
as a promising drug delivery system.

Investigation of Rice Husk Ash RHA thoroughly under controlled burning is
regular issue to obtain result to produce the amorphous silica that has high
pozzolanic reactivity characteristic. This paper offered an observation about
characteristic of ground and un-ground of un-controlled burning temperature RHA
that were taken from rice millings in Muar, Johor Malaysia. Such tests as X-Ray
Fluorescence XRF, X-Ray Diffraction XRD, Particle Size Analysis and Specific
Area Surface, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy FTIR, and Scanning
Electron microscope SEM were conducted in this investigation to carry out the
characteristic of RHA samples. The results show that the RHA was consist
approximately 89.90% of silica and the RHA possessed the amorphous particle were
dominant than its crystalline part. This proves that the RHA has a big potential
as a pozzolanic material considering the silica content and porous structure. In
addition, particle size analysis decides whether the pozzolanic reactivity can
be increased by grinding process.

Experimental investigation on static compressive toughness of steel fiber rubber
concrete. Recycled rubber particles can be produced by using waste tires. Adding
recycled rubber particles to concrete can form rubber concrete RC. RC can not
only reduce the amount of natural sand and reduce the cost of concrete but also
improve the static compressive toughness of concrete. Adding steel fiber into RC
can improve the strength of concrete. In order to study the compressive
toughness of steel fiber rubber concrete SFRC, rubber particles washed with NaOH
are added to steel fiber reinforced concrete. This can enhance the bonding
performance between the recycled rubber particles and concrete. The volume ratio
of recycled rubber is 5, 10, and 15%. Prismatic and cubic test blocks were
prepared and their compressive tests were carried out. The results show that the
stress interaction between the rubber particles and steel fiber in concrete
significantly improves the compressive strength, elastic modulus, and
stressstrain relationship of concrete. The compressive toughness and ductility
of concrete are improved. When the content of rubber particles is 1520%, the
compressive toughness of SFRC is improved most obviously. Through experiments,
the toughness index and specific toughness of rubber steel fiber reinforced
concrete are calculated, which explores a new way and method for studying the
compressive toughness of similar recycled material concrete.

Effect of Net-shaped and Skin-core Structure on the Evolution of Making High
Performance Carbon Fibers. It is necessary to make it clear the relationship
between the process of making carbon fibers and their structure and properties
by studying their supermolecular structure and morphological and crystal
structure in different stages. The formation of gel network and skin-core
structure was researched during the preoxidation and carbonization stages
depending on using the transmission electron microscopeTEM. The result shows
that the precursors take on apparent skin-core structure which is rough in outer
layer, the transitional zone lies between the outside skin zone and inside core
zone, the structure zone outside is thinner and more compact than that of skin
zone inside. The compact extent of meshwork of junction for carbon fibers is
directly related to that of precursors correspondingly, the more the junctions
of the precursors and the smaller the crystallites are, the more the junctions
of carbon fibers and the smaller the crystallites are, so the tensile strength
and modulus of the resultant carbon fibers are higher. The little crystal zone
distribution which is dispersed contributes to the tensile strength of carbon
fibers. The amount, size and distribution of little crystal zone which is
dispersed, and the compact extent of meshwork in precursors determine the
properties of the preoxidated fibers and that of the resultant carbon fibers.

Promising Biosurfactant Produced by<i>Cunninghamella echinulata</i>UCP 1299
Using Renewable Resources and Its Application in Cotton Fabric Cleaning Process.
A biosurfactant was produced from Cunninghamella echinulata using sustainable
technology for cleaning and degreasing of cotton fabric impregnated with burned
motor oil. The surface tension was 32.4 mN/m on a medium containing instant
noodle waste 2%, corn steep liquor 2%, and postfrying oil 0.5% with a
carbon/nitrogen ratio of 30 : 1, yield of 6.0 gL 1 , emulsifier index of 81.4%,
and dispersant property of 32.15 cm 2 . The biosurfactant produced is a
glycolipid constituted by carbohydrate 47.7% and lipids 50.0%. The structure was
confirmed by GC-MS stearic acid in predominance with mass of 298 m/z, FTIR
spectroscopy polysaccharides in bands between 1025 and 1152 cm 1 and fatty acids
in bands between 2057 and 3100 cm 1 , 1HNMR, and NMR spectrum carbohydrates in
signal of 4.38 ppm and 77.0 ppm. The properties of cleaning and degreasing of
burned engine oil in cotton fabric by biosurfactant of C. echinulata was
evidenced by removal of 86% of oil. After use of the biosurfactant, the fibers
were not damaged, which is important for structural integrity of cotton fabric
after the wash. In addition, the biosurfactant did not show toxic effect. This
study suggests that the biosurfactant from C. echinulata can be used in
formulation of textile detergents, in particular for removal of hydrophobic
residues from the automobile industry.

Study of 4HSiCHigh-Voltage Bipolar Diodes under Reverse Bias Using Electrical
and OBICCharacterization. 4HSiCP + NN + structures have been fabricated
following Medici TM software simulation in order to block voltages as high as 6
kV. In particular, these diodes are realized by surrounding the emitter by a
Aluminum-implanted ring called Junction Termination Extension JTE. Electrical
characterizations under reverse bias at room temperature and in various
environments air, SF6 show a premature breakdown of the diodes. This breakdown
is localized at the emitter periphery. OBICOptical Beam Induced Current
measurements show a peak of photocurrent at the emitter junction edge,
indicating the presence of a high electric field. These results involve an
effectiveness of 60 % of the JTE. This is probably related to a low electrical
activation of the implanted aluminum during the post-implantation annealing and
to the presence of positive charges at the surface of the devices.

Porosity formation mechanisms and fatigue response in AlSiMg alloys made by
selective laser melting. Defects in Al-7SiMg and Al-10SiMg alloys produced by
selective laser melting are categorised into three types. The first type are
large irregular-shaped defects with unmelted powder particles, formed due to a
lack of fusion as a result of insufficient volumetric energy density. The second
type are small round gas pores below 5m in diameter, associated with high area
energy density. These pores enlarge during solution heat treatment, but the
enlargement is reduced significantly when the powder is pre-dried at for 16h
under an argon atmosphere immediately before the build. The last type are large
round keyhole type pores located at the base of melt pools. They can either form
in contour scan regions, at the edges of core scans, or at island boundary
overlap regions due to an excessive local energy density compared with the
nominal energy density. Sub-surface porosity due to contour and core edge
keyhole type defects can be more detrimental to the fatigue performance than
net-shaped rough surfaces, but such sub-surface porosity can be minimised by
either lowering the laser energy input for the contour scan and/or changing the
way the laser turns between scan tracks.

Biodiesel Synthesis from Used Cooking Oil Using Red Mud as Heterogeneous
Catalyst. The problem associated with biodiesel production is economic
feasibility. The biodiesel cost will reduce when the low cost feedstock was used
as feedstock. Used Cooking Oil UCO is a promising candidate as raw material for
biodiesel synthesis. In this study, the investigation of biodiesel synthesis
from UCO was studied using red mud as heterogeneous catalysts. The catalyst was
prepared by impregnating Potassium metals on red mud. The catalyst physico-
characteristics were determined using Nitrogen gas adsorption, FT-IR, XRD, and
XRF. The catalyst was tested to synthesize biodiesel from UCO. The reaction
temperatures, methanol to oil mass ratio, and amount of catalyst were varied to

Toughness study of Borided, Borided and induction modified AISI 4340 steel. In
this study, pack boriding is done on AISI 4340 steel in steel containers for 3
hours at. Boriding results in the formation of FeB or Fe2B columnar
microstructure at the case. Such microstructure brings about a high brittleness
of the boride layer. Induction surface modification is done on Borided samples
to bring down the surface hardness. We put an effort to enhance the toughness of
boride layer using 30 kW power high frequency induction heat source. The
toughness of borided, borided and induction surface modified specimens are
evaluated by shear punch test. Cylindrical punch of 4 mm diameter is used in
this test. The toughness is calculated from the load-displacement curve.
Induction modified specimens exhibit 38% improvement in toughness as compared
with borided specimens. This improvement in toughness may be due to blunting of
acicular boride structure in to a globular structure at the interface, smooth
hardness gradient and formation of single phase Fe2B microstructure as a result
of induction surface modification.

Mechanical properties of a squeeze cast MgAlSr alloy. Purpose: The aim of the
present work is to study the influence of temperature on tensile properties of
the magnesium alloy AJ50, and to discuss possible hardening and softening
mechanisms and thermally activated processes. Design/methodology/approach:
Deformation behaviour of a MgAlSr magnesium alloy has been studied in tension as
well as compression in the temperature interval from room temperature up to.
Stress relaxation tests were performed with the aim to find applied stress
components internal stress and effective stress and parameters of the thermally
activated process/-es. Findings: The yield stress as well as the maximum stress
of the alloy are very sensitive to the testing temperature. The work hardening
coefficient =d/de decreases with increasing stress and temperature. Performed
analysis of the - plots determined the hardening and softening mechanisms
operating during the deformation. The internal stress decreses with increasin
temperature, while the effective stress component increases. Practical
implications: Estimated values of the activation volume as well as the
activation energy indicate that the main thermally activated process is
connected with the rapid decrease of the internal stress. Originality/value: An
analysis showed that the main hardening process is the storage of dislocations
at impenetrable obstacles. The activation volume values indicate that the main
thermally activated process is connected with recovery process.

Impact of development chemistry on extreme ultraviolet resist performance.
Tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide TBAH has recently been identified as a promising
material for aqueous base development of extreme ultraviolet EUV photoresists.
In this article, the merits and applicability of this new material are being
further investigated. In general, TBAH has no impact on line width roughness or
sensitivity performance when compared to conventional tetramethyl ammonium
hydroxide. It does, however, improve the pattern collapse performance of several
resists. Since pattern collapse is an important failure mechanism for EUV, TBAH
also improves ultimate resolution of these materials and allows overexposure to
target smaller critical dimensions. In contrast, several other resist platforms
show no impact of TBAH on their pattern collapse behavior. A mechanism is
proposed to explain this observation based on modification of the chemical
surface properties during development. This mechanism is supported by
independent contact angle measurements.

Synthesis of single-phase superparamagnetic copper ferrite nanoparticles using
an optimized coprecipitation method. The t-CuFe2O4 and c-CuFe2O4 are synthetised
under optimised condition. Synthesizedunder optimized conditions exhibited
superparamagnetic behavior. The solution pH has significant impact on
synthesizing either t-CuFe2O4 or c-CuFe2O4 . Calcination improves the purity and
stability ofnanoparticles. Single-phase superparamagnetic copper ferrite CF
nanoparticles with high surface area and low bandgap energy are vital for
industrial application in water treatment as a photocatalyst. In this study,
different synthesis parameters such as pH, reaction time, temperature, and
surfactant were optimized for the co-precipitation method. The influences of
each parameter on the porosity, structural, and magnetic properties were
evaluated. The highest observed saturation magnetization was 46.1 and 63.3 emu/g

and calcined at, respectively. The highest observed surface area was 247.6 m 2
/g for uncalcined CF. Allsynthesized under optimized conditions exhibited
superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature and have small bandgap energy
1.501.60 eV, making them easy to separate from treated water using an external
magnetic field and a potential candidate for visible light absorption in
photocatalysis applications, respectively. Finally, this study identified the
conditions required for synthesizing either cubic or tetragonal single-phase CF.

xGnP hybrid chemically modified electrode was developed and characterized for
the determination of organochlorine pesticides with nitro groups using quintozen
as a representative. The hybrid material was characterized by Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy FTIR, ultravioletvisible spectroscopy UVVIS and scanning
electron microscopy SEM. The electrochemical properties of the chitosanxGnP
modified electrode were characterized by a physical deposition method for
depositing it on a graphite electrode. Because of the affinity of the xGnP for
nitro groups, nitroaromatic organophosphate pesticides are attached to the
surface, allowing the extraction of quintozen within a short time 4min. The
differential pulse response was linear over the quintozen concentration range of
1012106M, and the current linearly increased with the quintozen concentrations
in two concentration ranges: from 1012 to 108M with the linear regression

During grinding of plastic waste particles are formed which have a different
size, shape and surface, from larger pieces to dust particles. Several recycled
mixtures were made, all from original material. Samples with different particle
size of recycled material were subsequently tested by mechanical testing.
Included tests were Charpy impact test and Shore hardness test. Testing was
conducted at different temperatures; ambient and increased temperatures 60 and.
The results show a very large effect on Charpy properties and a lesser influence
on the hardness of these mixtures. Mixture of smallest dust particles indicates

Friction, Wear, and Self-Lubrication. The second part of this book covers self-
lubrication and various issues related to the reduction of friction. Friction
and wear during sliding or rolling of solid surfaces are universal phenomena and
they reflect the tendencies of energy to dissipate and material to deteriorate,
which are consequences of the Second law of thermodynamics. In general, solid
surfaces in relative motion require lubrication, which dramatically reduces the
extent of friction and wear. The situation when no external lubrication is
required is called self-lubrication. There are many mechanisms of self-
lubrication ranging from coatings to embedding lubricant into the matrix of a
composite material, to self-organized in situ tribofilms, and to biological
surfaces.

Green Composites Using Lignocellulosic Waste and Cellulosic Fibers from Corn
Husks. This study explores the feasibility of using lignocellulosic waste and
cellulosic fibers from corn husks in the production of green composites, with
orthophthalic unsaturated polyester ortho-UP resin as a matrix. Lignocellulose
was extracted from corn husk fibers by alkali treatment using 1M NaOH, and the
dried lignocellulose extract was characterized using FTIR spectroscopy.
Composites containing varying weight fractions of lignocellulose, treated fibers
and ortho-UP were fabricated, and the tensile and flexural strengths and moduli
were measured. Based on the results, it was observed that the composite
containing 15wt% fiber possesses the highest tensile modulus, while the one with
20wt% lignocellulose showed the highest flexural modulus. The composites were
also subjected to scanning electron microscopy to examine the fracture surfaces
of the composites. Furthermore, the water sorption behavior of the composites
was also studied, and it was observed that all the composites obey Fickian
diffusion.

On the transformation pathways in TRIP/TWIP Ti12Mo alloy. Diverse pathways of
the deformation-induced transformations are investigated in the -metastable
Ti12Mo alloy displaying combined TWIP {332}<113> twinning and TRIP stress-
induced effects by means of Schmid factor analysis and in-situ microstructural
characterizations. Two sets of Schmid factors, for {332}<113> twinning and
stress-induced martensite, are calculated in grains of random orientation under
uniaxial tension condition. Using in-situ EBSD characterization under tension,
the correspondence is mapped between primary transformation products and the
grain orientations. The correspondence results graphically in four grain-
orientation domains in the inversed pole figure triangle, being twin-dominated,
martensite-dominated, combination of both, and the domain unfavorable for both
transformations. It is also found that the crystallographic partition of the
domains,e. the selection of transformation pathways with respect to grain
orientations, is related to the threshold of Schmid factor for the activation of
each transformation and the transformation strain of the corresponding
martensite variant. Guided by transformation partition mapping, grains at two
special orientations, dominated by stress-induced martensite with-or-without
primary {332}<113> twinning, are targeted in in-situ microstructural
observations to clarify the transformation pathways and the underlying
deformation mechanisms. Among the different pathways revealed, experimental
evidences are highlighted on the unprecedented formation mechanisms of
{332}<113> twins assisted by martensite {130}<310> deformation twinning via two
different ways. Distribution of the primary deformation mechanisms is described
and predicted via a new transformation partition mapping. Diverse transformation
pathways are clarified in Ti12Mo via a new transformation partition mapping
method and in-situ EBSD. The unprecedented formation mechanisms of {332} twins
assisted by {130} twinning via two different ways are observed.

and this caused lots of oil palm waste generated while the boiler ash clinker
BAC is one of the waste that left over after burning of the oil palm fibers,
empty fruit bunch etc. in a boiler which had mean how the boiler ask clinker
will come with a huge amount. In this research, the boiler ash clinker will be
used in concrete mixing by partially replace the coarse aggregate that used in
conventional concrete. The reason is that the coarse aggregate that use in a
concrete mix design is normally carry a high percentage compare to other
materials. The percentage of substitution is 5%, 10% and 15% of boiler ash
clinker in concrete. There are three 3 main objectives to be achieve in this
research which are: to determine the physical properties of boiler ash clinkers
on concrete, to determine the effect of boiler ash clinkers on concrete and to
identify the applicability of concrete from the gradation of substitution of
boiler ash clinkers as coarse aggregates in a concrete mix. Next, the
compressive strength and workability for the different percentage of
substitution of the boiler ash clinker in the concrete mixture will be identify
and analyze in this research. At the end of this research, the conclusion will
be made based on the three 3 main objectives and recommendation is given.

Effect of crystal field on the formation and diffusion of oxygen vacancy at
anatase 101 surface and sub-surface. The intrinsic oxygen vacancy Ov in TiO2 is
a vital topic of semiconductor materials. Here, we use the first-principles
calculations to explore the formation and diffusion properties of Ov at anatase
101 slab, combined with the crystal filed theory. The calculated result shows
that Ov at subsurface is not only more stable than that at surface, but also
prefers to cluster together at subsurface. The stability of Ov at subsurface is
mainly attributed to the Ti3d orbitals in different crystal fields occupied by
the excess electrons. Further calculation reveals that the Ov diffusion is
greatly affected by the excess electrons. These results presented here show the
importance of 3d orbitals in different crystal field, which should be helpful to
understand the behavior of Ov at other transition metal oxide.

An investigation of nanoparticles addition on solidification kinetics and
microstructure development of tinlead solder. High strength solders can be
engineered by adding trace amounts of nanopowders into solder paste. An
experimental study was conducted for a better understanding of the
solidification kinetics and microstructure development of such nano-composite
tinlead solders. The composite solder pastes were prepared by mechanically
mixing nanopowders of either copper or TiO2 with tinlead powders tens of microns
in size. Solidification experiments of the composite solders were performed in
an aluminum crucible with temperature variation during cooling and
solidification being measured. For the titanium dioxide TiO2 nanopowders-
reinforced composite solders, the test data reveals the occurrence of melt
undercooling followed by recalescence at an increased melting temperature.
However, for the copper nanopowders-reinforced composite solders, a reduced
melting temperature coupled with two-stages of solidification was distinctly
evident. Metallographic observations of the solidified composite solders
revealed a reduction in both the grain size and spacing of the eutectic
lamellae. This is responsible for the observed increase in microhardness.

Structural Characterization of Silica Particles Extracted from
Grass<i>Stenotaphrum secundatum</i>: Biotransformation via Annelids. This study
shows the structural characterization of silica particles extracted from
Stenotaphrum secundatum St. Augustine grass using an annelid-based
biotransformation process. This bioprocess starts when St. Augustine grass is
turned into humus by vermicompost, and then goes through calcination and acid
treatment to obtain silica particles. To determine the effect of the bioprocess,
silica particles without biotransformation were extracted directly from the
sample of grass. The characterization of the silica particles was performed
using Infrared FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM, X-ray Diffraction XRD, Dynamic Light Scattering DLS, and Energy Dispersion
Spectroscopy EDS. Both types of particles showed differences in morphology and
size. The particles without biotransformation were essentially amorphous while
those obtained via annelids showed specific crystalline phases. The biological
relationship between the metabolisms of worms and microorganisms and the
organic-mineral matter causes changes to the particles' properties. The results
of this study are important because they will allow synthesis of silica in
cheaper and more ecofriendly ways.

Effect of polyacrylonitrile PAN short fiber on the mechanical properties of
PAN/EPDM thermal insulating composites. Polyacrylonitrile short
fibers/ethylenepropylenediene terpolymer rubber PAN/EPDM composites are prepared
for the first time by mechanical mixing and subsequent vulcanization at for
50min to substitute for composites reinforced with aramid short fibers, as
thermal insulating materials. The relationships between fiber content and the
mechanical performances of the two kinds of composites are investigated. To
PAN/EPDM composites and aramid/EPDM composites, as the fiber content increases,
the tensile modulus, the tear strength and tensile strength increase, the break
elongation decreases, and the fracture mode of the two composites changes from
yielding prior to breaking to simultaneous yielding and breaking. PAN/EPDM
composites have higher elongation than aramid fiber/EPDM composites, but as
their mechanical properties such as tensile modulus, tear strength and tensile
strength are comparable, the former is expected to replace the later as a low
density thermal insulator.

The effect of aging on the yield stress of a single-crystal superalloy. The
yield stress in compression has been measured on the single-crystal superalloy
SRR99 at room temperature and at, the strain axis being 001. The effect of aging
time at has been studied, and also the effect of a post-aging treatment of 16 h
at. Transmission electron microscopy studies have revealed changes in
dislocation-particle interactions with aging treatment. The dislocation
configurations and the decrease in yield stress with increasing aging time are
consistent with the model due to Reppich of the shearing of ordered precipitates
by strongly coupled dislocations. The post-aging treatment gives rise to an
increase in yield stress and the operation of an alternative deformation
mechanism involving precipitate shear by partial dislocations. It is concluded
that these changes in deformation behaviour arise from the presence of an
increased volume fraction of phase, coupled with chemical changes at the
interface.

Study of wear resistance for epoxy reinforced with rockwool and nanoclay.
Composites materials specimens were prepared using a blend of epoxy+ unsaturated
polyester as a matrix, and reinforced with nanoclay 5 and 7.5 %Wt.% and rockwool
10% volume, keeping one specimen unreinforced as a reference specimen for
comparison. The optimum mixing ratio of epoxy and polyester was decided upon the
results of impact test results of the specimens blended in 50:50Wt.% of both
polymers, then 60:40Wt.%, 70:30Wt.%, 80:20Wt.% and 90:10Wt.% of epoxy and
polyester respectively, and the results showed that the blend of 80:20Wt.% of
epoxy and polyester respectively showed the highest impact strength, hence was
chosen as a matrix. The nanoclay and rockwool are used in combination to enhance
the wear resistance of the composite material, hence they can be used as
potential alternatives for brake pads and flooring applications. The results
showed an improvement in wear resistance when nano clays are introduced as
reinforcement and a further improvement took place when rockwool also was used
as a form of hybrid reinforcement, such that the wear rate dropped gradually
with the increase in reinforcement weight and volume fraction.

The characteristics of precipitation hardening and the shape memory effect in
aged Ti50.6Niu 9.8 Si0.2 shape memory ribbons. As-spun Ti50.6Niu 9.8 Si0.2 shape
memory ribbon fabricated by the melt-spinning technique is found to be partially
amorphous. The ribbon is crystallized at for different aging times.
Nanoindentation testing revealed the hardness of the amorphous region to be
about 7.8GPa, but that of the crystalline region is 3.1GPa. The average hardness
of the aged ribbon is 3.4GPa at15min aging and then decreases continuously.
In1h-aged ribbon, TEM observations show that GP zones and nanoscale Ti2Ni formed
in the primary grain, and only GP zones are observed in the crystallized
equiaxed grain. Both of these nanoscale precipitates strengthen the matrix and
cause precipitation hardening. The15min-aged ribbon exhibits an excellent shape
memory effect, with recoverable strain of 6.2%. The recoverable strain of the
ribbon gradually decreases with increasing aging time; however, it still shows
recoverable strain of >4% with irreversible strain of 50.6 Niu 9.8 Si0.2 ribbon
exhibits less thermal hysteresis than TiNi binary ribbons. Also, it has better
SME performance and is less brittle than Ti50Niu 25 ribbons in the early-aging

Aluminium-Lithium Alloy Welds. The tensile properties and fatigue crack growth
behaviour of sheets of an Al-1.9Li-1.8Cu-1.0 Mg-0.1Zr alloy welded under
different conditions were evaluated. The basic welding technique was constant
current CC gas tungsten arc GTA welding. Two modifications viz. pulsed current
PC and magnetic arc oscillation AO were introduced to study effects on
microstructure and properties. Both PC and AO resulted in microstructural
refinement in the fusion zone. The tensile residual stresses present in CC welds
reduced when either PC or AO welding was used. The tensile strength and
ductility increased, and fatigue crack growth rates lowered when PC or AO
conditions replaced CC welding.

Physical and electrochemical properties of cobalt doped Ti,RuO2 electrode
coatings. Cobalt doped oxide displays crystallites half the size compared to
undoped oxide. Crystallites half the size are in agreement with twice as large
active area. The cobalt dopand joined with the Ti,RuO2 in rutile phase, as no
spinel was found. Doped electrodes showed an increase in activity for hydrogen
evolution. Similar activity was shown for chlorine evolution comparing doped and
undoped oxides. The physical and electrochemical properties of ternary oxides
Ti0.7Ru0.3 x Co x O2 x = 0.093 and x = 0 have been investigated and compared.
Samples of three different thicknesses were prepared by spin-coating onto
polished titanium to achieve uniform and well-defined coatings. The resulting
electrodes were characterized with a variety of methods, including both physical
and electrochemical methods. Doping with cobalt led to a larger number of
micrometer-sized cracks in the coating, and coating grains half the size
compared to the undoped samples 10 instead of 20 nm across. This is in agreement
with a voltammetric charge twice as high, as estimated from cyclic voltammetry.
There is no evidence of a Co3O4 spinel phase, suggesting that the cobalt is
mainly incorporated in the overall rutile structure of the Ti,RuO2 . The doped
electrodes exhibited a higher activity for cathodic hydrogen evolution compared
to the undoped electrodes, despite the fact that one third of the active
ruthenium was substituted with cobalt. For anodic chlorine evolution, the
activity was similar for both electrode types.

On evaluating fit of the LifshitzSlyozovWagner LSW distribution to particle size
data. Statistical procedures to determine whether particle size data can be
characterized by the LSW distribution have been developed by using two methods
to estimate the population average: sample mean and maximum likelihood. Two
goodness-of-fit tests, namely the KolmogorovSmirnov and AndersonDarling
statistics, have been assessed by Monte Carlo simulations for seven sample sizes
ranging from 10 to 1000. Results indicate that the fitting method has a profound
effect on the critical values of the two tests for all sample sizes. It has also
been determined that cut-off censoring of the data by finite resolution in
microscopy has negligible effect on the evaluation of the fit. Procedures are
demonstrated on one dataset from the literature.

Microstructure evolution of SIMA processed Al2024. In this paper, the strain
induced melt activated SIMA process of A2024 was investigated systematically in
order to provide a basis for semi-solid forming of the alloy. To delete the
hydrostatic component of stress, the uniform uniaxial compression process is
performed. The relation between the grain size and strain before heating is
presented and a microstructure evolution model for SIMA is proposed on the basis
of experiment. There include two steps in SIMA process. In the first step of
plastic deformation, there are two mechanisms to control the deformation, slip
or cross-slip or twinning in grain and grain rotation. The deviatory stress will
benefit to slip or cross-slip or twinning in grains, and the hydrostatic stress
will benefit to rotation of gain. In the second step of heating, the grain
boundary will melt first and the shape of the grains will be globe.

Electrical conductivity of graphite fiber-epoxy resin composites. The electrical
conductivity of graphite fiber-epoxy resin composites was measured for samples
containing 64 or 65 vol.% of carbon fibers. Measurements made at angles of 0,
30, 45, 60 and 90 with respect to the nominal fiber axis verify that these
systems can be described by a conductivity tensor with principal axes along and
normal to the fiber axis. The longitudinal conductivity 1 is calculated from the
simple law of mixtures. Since the epoxy matrix is non-conducting, the transverse
conductivity t is theoretically zero for fibers which are all separated. We
assumed that the measured conductivity results from contact between neighboring
fibers due to an irregular arrangement and we based our theoretical treatment on
the random resistor network model of Kirkpatrick. The possible conductance
values are determined by the number of fiber contacts in a given sample
thickness with the fiber contacts distributed according to a binomial
probability law. The model thus is capable of accounting for the observed
thickness dependence of t. A detailed comparison of the predictions of this
theory with experiment is presented.

the exterior properties of components and coatings that require a fine surface
finishing with over high temperature range. High- entropy alloys HEA have become
a ground-breaking research field that provides solutions for structural/
functional materials in the aerospace industry. These alloys, fabricated via
direct metal deposition, have better properties than those produced by arc
melting. However, the poor surface finish acquired by the layer-by-layer laser
deposition process fails to meet the industrial requirements. The implementation
of surface treatment by centrifugal barrel finishing is employed to improve the
surface roughness of AlCoCrCuFeNi laser deposited HEA. The results have shown a
minimum surface roughness decrease of 40%. Thus, an improved surface finish was

Preparation and spectral properties of solar selective absorbing MoSi2 -Al2O3
coating. A novel solar selective absorbing MoSi2Al2O3 multilayer coating
deposited on Cu or stainless steel SS substrate by magnetron sputtering is
reported. The coating consists of an infrared reflective metal layer using Mo or
Cu, an absorption MoSi2Al2O3 bilayer, and an anti-reflection Al2O3 layer from
substrate to top. With the help of computer simulation, we obtain the optimal
metal volume fraction and thickness of each layer on Cu substrate. And then a
good optical performance / of 0.94/0.06/ for the all-layer coating on Cu
substrate is obtained. On the other hand, the influence of the deposition
parameters for the infrared reflective Mo layer on the emittance is discussed.
The emittance decreases with the decrease of sputtering pressure and the
increase of the target power. The lowest emittance of the SS substrate/Mo is
0.047 after optimization. The optical performance / of the all-layer coating on
the optimized SS/Mo substrate is 0.95/0.07/. The thermal stability of the all-
layer coating on SS substrate is evaluated, and it is found to have a good

Quantitative phase analysis in microstructures which display multiple step
martensitic transformations in Ni-rich NiTi shape memory alloys. In the present
study, we investigate a microstructure which shows a three-step martensitic
transformation on cooling from the high temperature regime and two DSC peaks on
heating. Using in situ neutron diffraction phase analysis based on Rietveld full
profile fitting it is shown how the volume fractions of B2, R and B19 phases
evolve during the three step transformation on cooling and the reverse
transformation on heating. We used TEM as a complementary method to support our
neutron diffraction findings. The first DSC peak on cooling is related to a
complete transformation of the B2 matrix to R phase and the second and third
peak on cooling are associated with the formation of B19 in two stages. On
heating also, the B19R transformation is accumulating in two stages, with the
second stage overlapping with the RB2 transition.

Reinforcement size effect on thermal conductivity in CuB/diamond composite. In
the Cu/diamond composites modified by metal matrix alloying, the interfacial
thermal conductance depends on the in-situ formed interfacial carbide layer that
further depends on the diamond particle size. We fix boron alloying content as
0.3 wt% and vary diamond particle size from 66 to 701 m to tune interfacial
carbide layer with an attempt to separate the two dependences of diamond
particle size and interfacial thermal conductance. The Cu-0.3 wt% B/diamond
composite exhibits a slowing increase in thermal conductivity as the diamond
particle size is larger than 300 m because of a simultaneous decrease in the
interfacial thermal conductance. A high thermal conductivity of 904 W/m K is
obtained with diamond particle size of 701 m. The findings emphasize the
importance of tailoring interfacial carbide layer to attain high thermal
conductivity in the Cu/diamond composites modified by metal matrix alloying.

Strain-tunable giant anisotropic conductivity in the polar metal of KNbO3/BaTiO3
ferroelectric superlattice. Anisotropy in crystals originates from different
periodicity atomic arrangements along with different crystallographic
directions, leading to different physical properties of the crystal in different
directions, which is particularly pronounced in two-dimensional 2D materials. In
this work, by using first-principles calculations, we predicted the tunable
giant electrical anisotropy of the KNbO3/BaTiO3KNO/BTO ferroelectric
superlattice SL between in-plane and out-of-plane directions through the in-
plane strain-engineering. The anisotropy ratio of electrical conductivity and
electronic thermal conductivity shows an exponentially increase when the KNO/BTO
SL undergoes a strain from tensile to compressive, and their anisotropy ratio
can be tuned from several times to over 105 at room temperature. In addition,
the compressively strained KNO/BTO SL has a large out-of-plane Seebeck
coefficient and a high anisotropic thermopower. This anisotropy of the KNO/BTO
SL primarily derives from the proportion of electrons occupied by dxy and
dxz/dyz orbitals and that proportion is highly dependent on the polarization
intensity of the KNO/BTO SL. Moreover, the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic
properties of the KNO/BTO SL can be tuned by strain due to the coexistence of
polar structure and metallicity. Our results provide a road map for creating
multifunctional materials at perovskite oxides interfaces, which may be
favorable for designing new volatile memory devices with anisotropy-based
ultrafast and low-power properties.

Preparation and Characterization of Magnetic Carbonate Apatite/Chitosan/Alginate
Composite Scaffold. Treatment for bone cancer has begun to be experimented with
ferrimagnetic for magnetic induction hyperthermia. On the other hand, composites
of bioceramics and biopolymer have been studied for scaffold as these materials
resemble the structure of bone. The current study investigated the magnetization
of calcium aluminum ferrite magnetic CaAl4Fe8O19 incorporated in carbonate
apatite, alginate and chitosan, that serves as a scaffold. CaAl4Fe8O19 powder
were synthesized using calcium nitrate, aluminium nitrate and ferrous chloride
using the sol-gel method. Combining the carbonate apatite/chitosan/alginate
compoiste and CaAl4Fe8O19 using the freeze-dry method has produced carbonate
apatite/alginate/chitosan/CaAl4Fe8O19 composite scaffolds. The CaAl4Fe8O19
powder and the scaffolds were observed using SEM scanning electrone microscope
and their magnetization were measured using VSM vibrating sample magnetometer.
It was shown that the scaffold is a composite structure of CaAl4Fe8O19
particles, having diameter ranging from 0.5 to 2 m, embedded in the pore walls
of the carbonate apatite/alginate/chitosan matrix. The saturation
magnetizationand remanence magnetization Mr of the CaAl4Fe8O19 particles were 20
and 2.0 emu/g, whereas, those of the magnetic scaffold were 4.3 and 2.0 emu/gr.
The addition of the carbonate apatite/alginate/chitosan composite into
CaAl4Fe8O19 decreased the fraction and/or magnetic of the CaAl4Fe8O19 particles.

Titanium dioxidecellulose hybrid nanocomposite and its glucose biosensor
application. This paper investigates the fabrication of titanium dioxide
TiO2cellulose hybrid nanocomposite and its possibility for a conductometric
glucose biosensor. TiO2 nanoparticles were blended with cellulose solution
prepared by dissolving cotton pulp with lithium chloride/N,N-dimethylacetamide
solvent to fabricate TiO2cellulose hybrid nanocomposite. The enzyme, glucose
oxidase GOx was immobilized into this hybrid nanocomposite by physical
adsorption method. The successful immobilization of glucose oxidase into
TiO2cellulose hybrid nanocomposite via covalent bonding between TiO2 and GOx was
confirmed by X-ray photoelectron analysis. The linear response of the glucose
biosensor is obtained in the range of 110mM. This study demonstrates that

From thin film and coating buckling structures to mechanical properties. Thin
films and coatings produced by sputtering methods often develop very high
internal stresses, sometimes about few GPa in compression and are then
susceptible to delamination and buckling. Although this phenomenon is
undesirable for future technological applications, one may take benefit of it
for intrinsic mechanical properties characterization of both films and
substrates. Most of buckling patterns can be simply understood in the frame of
elastic theory, as an optimum release of stresses in the film. In this way, the
geometrical analysis of buckling structures can be thought as an easy and
interesting method to determine the mechanical properties of the thin films and
coatings that can be strongly different from those of bulk crystals. This method
was successfully applied to extract the elastic properties of a stainless steel
600 nm thick film deposited on silicon wafers.

The Material Flow Analysis in the Modified Orbital Forging Technology. The main
aim of this work is the computer aided design of the new orbital forging
process. The finite element model was developed and used in research on
possibility of modification of the classical orbital forging technology based on
the Marciniak press to obtain more effective process. Obtained numerical results
from simulations of the new orbital process are compared with the experimental
analysis, performed on the orbital press with the developed device. However, due
to the novelty of the developed approach the investigation on direction of
material flow during deformation is of particular interest in this work.
Direction of material flow and strain path change effect due to incremental
character of deformation is analyzed. Obtained results confirm good predictive
capability of the FE model and are the basis for the comparison of the two
processes and discussion on the effectiveness of the modified incremental
forming process.

Multi-physics modeling of grain growth during solidification in electron beam
additive manufacturing of Inconel 718. While experimental work has shown
promising results regarding control of additive manufacturing metal grain
structure, the effects of processing parameters on the grain structure is
difficult to understand and predict from experiment alone. To this end, a
modeling framework is developed which sequentially couples a macro-scale, semi-
analytic thermal model, and a meso-scale, cellular automata-based microstructure
model. This framework is applied to electron beam additive manufacturing of
Inconel 718 using a complex spot scan pattern. The model shows that, with the
same scan pattern, variations in the spot time and electron-beam current produce
thermal histories with significant spatial and temporal differences, which then
produce complex solidification conditions from the interplay between molten
pools in the same layer and subsequent layers, resulting in vastly different
grain structures. It is noted that the framework can significantly reduce the
computational expenses for coupled thermal-metallurgical problems, and has the
potential to be used for component level problems.

Effect of Indium on Plastic Deformation of Magnesium Single Crystals. Indium-
magnesium alloys single crystals were deformed in tension and compression for
basal, prismatic and pyramidal slip and the variations of the critical resolved
shear stress against the temperature are described. For basal slip, indium
alloying shows a solution hardening with the power two thirds of the indium
concentration and a repeated yielding phenomenon within a certain temperature
range; the repeated yielding is related to the movement of indium atoms. For non
basal slip, the concentration dependence of the yield stress is very small in
alloys containing up to 2 at. % of indium strained with a low strain rate.

Precipitation of Ti,V2AlC,N in multiphase AlTiV alloys. Precipitation of the
complex carbonitride Ti,V2AlCN in multiphase AlTiV alloys with compositions
based on Al3Ti has been studied using analytical transmission electron
microscopy. Plate-like precipitate particles were observed in association with a
range of phases, including -Al3Ti,V, -Ti2Al5 , -Ti5Al11 , -Al8V5 and the
metallic -Ti,V following chill-casting and subsequent isothermal heat
treatments. They were formed preferentially along the interphase boundaries
between the or , and phases in heat treated duplex microstructures. Electron
diffraction confirmed the crystal structure of the precipitates designated h
phase to be hexagonal a = 0.297 nm, c = 1.354 nm, consistent with carbides or
nitrides of the form M 2 AlC or M 2 AlN M = Cr, V, Ti, Nb. The orientation
relationship most common between the h and phases was such that 0001 h 111 and
110 h 10 while a relationship of the form 0001 h 110 , and 110 h 11 , was
observed between the h and b.c.c. and phases. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis
indicated that the h phase has a stoichiometry of the form Ti,V2Al, while
electron energy loss spectra revealed the presence of both C and N, implying
that the precipitate is the product of a solid solution between isostructural
Ti2AlCN and V2AlCN.

Developing fuel cladding Fe-25Cr-22Ni stainless steels with high microstructural
stabilities via Mo/Nb/Ti/Ta/W alloying. In order to improve the microstructural
stability of high Cr/Ni austenitic stainless steelsat high temperatures, the
present work investigated the effects of minor-alloying elements Mo, Nb, Ti, Ta,
and W on the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of Fe-25Cr-22Ni
wt% ASS systematically. The designed alloy ingots were hot-rolled, solid-
solutioned at for 0.5h, stabilized at for 0.5h, and then aged at for different
hours. It was found that these minor-alloying elements make different
contributions to the microstructural stabilities of alloys. Only a small amount
of harmful particles exists after 408h-aging in W/Ta-modified alloys, which
indicates W and Ta can improve the microstructural stability effectively.
Whereas Ti should be forbidden since it accelerates the phase precipitation of
Cr6 and remarkably. Excessive Mo can also promote the formation of phase and the
transformation of Cr6 to during aging. The influences of the precipitated phases
on mechanical properties of alloys were then studied. Thermal calculations were
also performed to analyze the phase precipitation caused by minor-alloying. The
Fe-25Cr-22Ni-0.046C-0.73Mo-0.18Nb-0.34Ta wt% exhibits excellent mechanical
property due to its higher microstructural stability at, which has great
potential for fuel cladding application.

Interface interaction-mediated design of tough and conductive MXene-composited
polymer hydrogel with high stretchability and low hysteresis for high-
performance multiple sensing. Conductive hydrogels based on two-dimensional 2D
nanomaterials, MXene, have emerged as promising materials for flexible wearable
sensors. In these applications, the integration of high toughness,
ultrastretchability, low hysteresis, self-adhesiveness, and multiple sensory
functions into one gel is essential. However, serious issues, such as easy
restacking and inevitable oxidation of MXene nanosheets in aqueous media and
weak interfacial bindings between MXene and the gel network, make it almost
impossible to achieve the multiple performances mentioned above. Here we present
a conductive MXene-composited polymer MCP hydrogel by incorporating gelatin-
modified MXene into polyacrylamide PAAm hydrogel for the fabrication of
multifunctional sensors. The presence of gelatin not only greatly improves the
stability of the MXene nanosheets by forming a protective sheath, but also
largely enhances the interfacial interactions between the MXene and the hydrogel
network as molecular glues. Thus, the MCP hydrogel exhibits a high strength 430
kPa, remarkable stretchability 1100%, low hysteresis <10% at 500% cyclic
tensile, and excellent repeatable adhesion. The resultant MCP hydrogel-based
versatile sensors display a high strain sensitivity with a broad working range
gauge factor GF = 8.83, up to 1000%, realizing the detection of various human
motions. Moreover, the prepared sensors possess superior thermosensitive
capacities 1.110/C for the measurement of body temperature. This strategy opens
horizons to designing high-performance MXene-based hydrogels for advanced
sensing platforms.

Crystallographic study of fatigue crack growth in FeSi alloy single crystals.
Crystallographic fatigue crack growth has been studied using ironsilicon single
crystals having a notch plane of 110 or 112. In crystals containing a notch
direction within an angle of 35 to 001 on a notch plane of 110, a crack grows by
the separation of slip planes on the basis of evenly operated alternating shear
on the intersecting slip systems at the crack tip. These crystals exhibit
considerably high resistances to fatigue crack growth. In a crystal with a notch
direction rotated at an angle of 55 to 001 on 110, two competing mechanisms,e.
cleavage-like cracking related to the generation of sessile dislocations and
saw-toothed feature formation due to the activation of multiple slip systems,
appeared instead of an alternating shear mechanism. When alternating shear
occurs unevenly on asymmetrically arranged slip planes, the fatigue crack growth
resistance is low as compared to that in the case in which it occurs evenly.

Crystallization behavior of amorphous FeMo alloys. New alloys of FexMo100x over
the whole composition range have been prepared by the sputtering method. It was
found by X-ray diffraction that samples with 40 x 80 are amorphous, while the
remaining alloys are single phase with the b.c.c. structure. In this paper, we
report that a very high crystallization temperature Tcr of around has been
observed from the electrical resistivity measurements for amorphous FexMo100x
samples and that Tcr rises as the molybdenum content increases. After
crystallization, the magnetic properties of these samples were studied using a
vibrating-sample magnetometer. The results indicate that compositional
dependence of the magnetic ordering temperatures Tc of these crystallized
samples can be well described by the same equation as that for as-made
crystalline samples, which is Tcx = 39 x 200.75 Also, further heating at high
temperatures causes the segregation of -Fe and molybdenum atoms.

Research of the microstructure and precipitation strengthening in a high-
temperature FeNi superalloy. The paper describes the relationships between the
kinetics of precipitation and growth of the intermetallic phase ' - Ni3Al,Ti and
the strengthening magnitude obtained in a high-temperature FeNi superalloy of
the A-286 type. In order to accomplish the goal of the study, the author used
the LSW coagulation theory and Brown and Ham's conventional analysis of
strengthening by ordered particles. The samples were subjected to a solution
heat treatment at/2h/water and then aged at 715, 750 and, with holding times
0.5-500 h. The heat-treated samples were subjected to structural analyses TEM,
X-ray diffraction and analyses of mechanical properties hardness test, static
tensile test. Direct measurements on the electron micrographs allowed to
calculate the structural parameters of the ' phase,e. mean diameter, volume
fraction and mean distance between particles. In accordance with the LSW theory,
linear dependencies of changes in mean diameter as a function of ageing time
t1/3/ were elaborated and the activation energy E of the ' phase coagulation
process was determined. The author carried out analyses of strengthening and
flow stress 0 increases as a function of the particle size of the ' phase and
determined the value of the antiphase boundary energy yapb for the analyzed FeNi
alloy. It was found that the value of APB energy of phase ' depended
significantly on the alloy ageing temperature. Such a dependence of the quantity
yapb on the ageing temperature for the investigated alloy was explained by an
increase in the degree of internal arrangement of phase ' and by increasing
sizes of ordered domains as a result of coalescence.

Influence of Casing Pressure Test on Seal Integrity of Cementing First
Interface. Casing pressure test is an important link of the oil and gas well
cementing, but excessive casing pressure test may cause stress failure or
plastically deformation of the cement sheath, and generate micro-annulus on the
casing-cement sheath cemented surface, then lose seal integrity of the cement
sheath. According to the basic theory of elastoplastic mechanics and considering
the volume invariance of plastic strain and the influence of elastic strain on
volume change, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion is used to establish the casing-cement
sheath-surrounding rock combination model. The paper also derived the formula
for calculating the micro-annulus of the casing pressure test, and analyzed the
influence of the internal pressure of the casing during the pressure test and
the elastic modulus of the cement sheath on the radial contact stress of the
cement sheath cementation interface after the cementing operation is completed.
Results show that: 1 The generation of micro-annulus of casing pressure test is
determined by the pressure increase process and the pressure relief process. The
pressure increase process may lead the cement sheath into plasticity, and the
radial stress at the interface turns into tensile stress and the micro-annulus
could appear at the first interface by the decrease of internal pressure during
pressure relief process. 2 The varying internal pressure has a great influence
on the fatigue failure of the cement sheath, so the continuous multiple casing
pressure test should be avoided after the cementing is completed. 3 Under the
condition of maintaining the integrity of the cement sheath, increasing the
tensile strength of the cement stone and reducing the elastic modulus of the
cement stone can improve the pressure bearing capacity of the first interface
during the casing pressure test. The model can provide a theoretical basis for
the mechanical parameter design of the cement sheath, and provide guidance for
on-site construction to reduce or avoid the risk of failure of the first
interface seal integrity for the casing pressure test.

analysed by means of optical microscopy, SEM and X-ray diffraction methods. The
cellular grain size dG, lamellar spacing L, volume fraction of Ti2Cu phases fv
and microhardness HV were measured. The addition of Sn content into the Ti7Cu
alloy can effectively increase the solubility of Cu in the eutectoid
microstructure -Ti+Ti2Cu, induce transformation of ultrafine martensite

decrease of strain rate. Based on the hyperbolic sine equation, a constitutive
equation is a relation between 0.2pct yield stress and deformation conditions
strain rate and deformation temperature was established. The corresponding hot

Phase-field models for colloidal systems: First steps, perspectives and open
challenges. One of the great perspectives arising from the investigation of
colloids today is, that they have matured to be seen as an experimentally easily
accessable model system for fundamental problems of materials science. Phase-
field models can support respective experimental investigations via
corresponding simulation studies that test, verify and extrapolate hypothesis
obtained from such experiments. The aim of this article is to elucidate the
perspectives originating from the combination of both to a comprehensive
experimental simulation model approach for basic open issues underlying todays
challenge to tailor new materials with continuously improving materials
properties. In this article the perspectives as well as the methodological open
issues of such a comprehensive experimental simulation approach based on
colloidal systems is pointed out at the example of nucleation. Furthermore, an
outlook on analogous perspectives for defect nucleation and dislocation dynamics

lowest Youngs modulus 76 GPa among all sintered Ti-10Mn and Ti-14Mn
specimens.The tensile strength of TiMn alloys is almost equal to that of Ti64
ELI; further, their Youngs modulus islower than that of Ti-6Al-4V ELI. The
relative bone contact ratio of Ti-12Mn increases from 11% to 29%with increasing

Influence of deformation and annealing on electrical conductivity, mechanical
properties and texture of AlMgSi alloy cables. AlMgSi alloys are medium-strength
high-conductivity alloy cable materials that are ideal candidates for electrical
engineering applications, but their related electrical conductivity, mechanical
properties and textures must be studied in greater detail before such
applications can be realized. Different deformation strains 0.98, 1.73 and 2.24
and annealing temperatures 200500C were applied to optimize these properties in
AlMgSi alloy cables. The results show that the recrystallized AlMgSi alloy
cables exhibit medium yield strength and higher electrical conductivity compared
to the non-recrystallized AlMgSi alloy cables with larger average grain sizes.
After annealing, the main contributors to the overall texture were the Brass and
Goss textures. According to theoretical evaluations, the significant increase in
electrical conductivity and decrease in yield strength can be attributed to the
decreasing dislocation density and changes to the grain boundaries.

Comparing Various Type of Natural Fibers as Filler in TPU: Mechanical
Properties, Morphological and Oil Absorption Behavior. The idea of using natural
fibers as filler in various polymers has been extensively studied. Various types
of natural fibers and polymers have been identified and it can be varied
according to the particular application and the two main composite materials
will have advantages and disadvantages of each. However, natural fibers are
usually selected as filler because it is readily available and environmentally
friendly, inexpensive, non-toxic, biodegradable and still have good
characteristics for a variety of uses. In this study, four types of natural
fiber have been used which; coconut shell, coconut fiber, corn cob, and
pineapple skin, as fillers in thermoplastic polyurethane TPU. The mixing process
conducted through melt mixing techniques. The percentage of TPU and natural
fibers are 100/0/, 95/5/, 90/10/ and 85/15/. Different type of fiber will affect
the mechanical properties of the composites and have been studied through
tensile testing. It showed that the result for pineapple fiber at 5% was the
highest and can also be related to the characterizations of this composite that
have been studied via the SEM morphology. Swelling testing is also having been
done to prove the absorbency ability by natural fiber composites in cooking oil
and engine oil. Then it concluded that the pineapple fiber absorbed large amount
of both oil compared to others.

Softening of Low-alloyed Titanium Billets with Laser Annealing. An experimental
study of work-hardened metal release conditions and recrystallized structure
formation with laser heating, which showed the possibility of these processes in
low-alloy titanium was performed. Studies of treated materials properties showed
that using of laser annealing enhances ultimate tensile strain and reduces
minimum bend angle for cold deformation of rolled sheet metal parts of these
materials. Using of laser annealing for local softening before shaping billets
of titanium alloys allows to improve the accuracy of parts manufacturing by
reducing their springy action. This provides an opportunity to expand their
shaping options without additional heating.

Slow halide exchange in CsPbIBr2 films for high-efficiency, carbon-based, all-
inorganic perovskite solar cells. Halide exchange offers a versatile way to
modify the properties of halide perovskites, but it is particularly challenging
to slow the reaction rate to restrain defect growth in the products. Herein, we
propose a slow halide exchange strategy to simultaneously fine-tune the optical
and microstructural characteristics of CsPbIBr2 films by physically pairing
CsPbIBr2 and CH3NH3PbI3 films. Once a proper heating treatment is applied,
halide exchange of Br and I ions between the films is activated, and the
reaction rate can be well controlled by the heating recipe, in which a high
temperature can accelerate the exchange reaction, while a low temperature slows
or stops it. By using an optimal halide exchange temperature 110C and time 2 h,
the parent CsPbIBr2 film was transformed into high-quality CsPbI1+xBr2x film,
featuring an extended absorption onset from 590 to 625 nm, coarsened grains,
improved crystallinity, reduced surface roughness, suppressed halide phase
segregation, and identical stability to the pristine film. Accordingly, the
efficiency of a carbon-based, all-inorganic perovskite solar cell PSC was
boosted to 10.94%, which was much higher than that of the pristine CsPbIBr2 film
8.21%. The CsPbI1+xBr2x PSC also possessed excellent tolerance against heat and
moisture stresses.

Impact of partial recrystallization on the mechanical properties of severely
deformed copper. Combination of severe plastic deformation SPD and heat
treatment are used as a processing route for producing bimodal grain size
copper. Simple shear extrusion is used for SPD processing of samples to reach an
ultrafine grain structure which is followed by annealing at different
temperatures ranging between and and different soaking times. Partial
recrystallization resulted in a bimodal structure which is observed by optical
microscope. Mechanical properties of the samples are characterized by shear

Mechanical Properties and Acoustic Emission Characteristics of Thawing Frozen
Sandstone. After the construction of a frozen shaft wall is completed, it
undergoes a long thawing process. Damage accumulation under load may result in
the rupture of the frozen wall and cause engineering accidents. The change in
the mechanical properties of the frozen rock during the thawing process is
crucial to the stability of the frozen wall. In this study, we selected
Cretaceous saturated sandstone as the research object and performed uniaxial
compression tests on the frozen sandstone to analyze its mechanical properties
during the thawing process. In addition, acoustic emission technology was used
to analyze the damage and failure characteristics of the rock. The main findings
of the study are as follows: 1 the results of the uniaxial compression tests
revealed that the thawing of frozen sandstone comprises five stages. The closure
stress, crack initiation stress, expansion strength, and peak strength were
obtained from the volumetric stress-strain curve. These four stress values act
as the dividing points of the five stages. 2 The initiation stress of frozen
sandstone at different temperatures accounts for approximately 50% of the peak
strength. The strength value is low, the deformation is large, and it exhibits
an obvious strain-softening phenomenon. 3the temperature increases, the closure
level of the saturated sandstone gradually increases, and the crack initiation
and expansion levels gradually decrease. 4 Based on the four characteristic
stresses of the thawing process of frozen sandstone, the acoustic emission
signal can be divided into a quiet period, an increasing period, a frequent
period, a sharp increase period, and a decline period. 5 A frozen sandstone
damage model was established based on the D-P failure criterion. The efficacy of
the model was evaluated against the test data and was found to be reasonably
accurate. This paper uses acoustic emission technology to simultaneously monitor
the melting process of frozen rocks and reveal the relationship between
intensity and temperature. The results provide theoretical and technical support
for evaluating the mechanical damage induced by thawing of a frozen shaft wall.

A hybrid model on severe plastic deformation of copper. A hybrid model based on
the flow function and dislocation cell structure model by considering the Taylor
assumption is utilized to model the dislocation structure evolution, cell size
and mechanical properties of OFHC in severe plastic deformation. Here, the ECAP
is chosen as a process of severe plastic deformation. In this study, the model
is modified by taking the value of cell size coefficient as a function of strain
and considering two different values of dynamic recovery coefficients of cell
walls and cell interiors. These modifications lead to achieve the more accurate
modeling results. From the flow function the strain rate distribution are
achieved and then using the model the dislocation density, cell walls thickness,
walls fraction, cell size, and strength are predicted. The predicted cell size
and strength are compared with the experimental data and a remarkable agreement
is obtained.

Electron interference effects and strong localization in Cu doped ZnO thin
films. Electron interference effects and transition from weakly localized to a
strongly localized transport regime is observed in Cu doped ZnO thin films grown
by pulsed laser deposition on c-sapphire substrates. The doping concentration of
Cu was varied from 0% to 10%. Up to the doping concentration of ~ 0.5%, the
films showed weakly localized behavior where quantum corrections to conductivity
due to electron interference was active. At these doping concentrations, a
transition from 3D to 2D weak localization was also observed as the measurement
temperature was decreased. But at Cu concentrations of 5% and beyond, the films
were found to show behavior of strong localization where the transport at low
temperature was dominated by hopping mechanism.

Inverse Analysis Procedure for Identifying Material Parameters of Hypoplastic
Constitutive Model for Soils. In this paper we present an inverse analysis
method for material parameter identification applied to the hypoplastic
constitutive model for soils. The proposed method is classified as a direct-
approach one, since the discrepancy between the material responses, measured and
calculated by means of the finite element method is directly minimized. In the
presented work this minimization is made up of the modified Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization method based on the so-called trust region approach. We provide a
numerical example of parameter identification for a triaxial test performed on a
sand material, supplemented by the analysis of the influence of the initial
guesses of the parameters to be identified, as well as the errors in the
measured control data on the identification process.

Correlation of DC and AC electrical properties of Al/p-Si structure by IVT and
CG/VT measurements. Currentvoltagetemperature and admittance-gate
biastemperature measurements were performed on Al/p-Si structure to investigate
transport and storage properties. In forward direction of former measurement,
three distinct voltage regions designated different transport mechanisms:
recombination, tunneling and space charge limited current. In the reverse
direction, current seemed to be roughly proportional to the square root of bias
at low region. Activation energy EA as 0.56 eV together with the ideality factor
around 1.5 confirmed that generationrecombination current was the actual current
transport mechanism. Increase in applied bias resulted in the appearance of
other mechanisms: tunneling and space charge limited current, deduced by
temperature-independent current flow and power of bias greater than 2 in both
forward and reverse directions, respectively. On the other hand, the distinctive
bias voltage regions in currentvoltagetemperature measurement corresponded to
inverting, depleting and accumulating gate bias regimes in typical M1+S
structure for admittance analysis. Conductance branch of admittance reflected a
similar behavior with that of the measurement under both temperature and
frequency as parameter. On the other hand, with the aid of capacitance branch of

Simulation of Low Frequency Electromagnetic DC Casting. A comprehensive
multiphysics model has been developed to describe the effect of the low
frequency electromagnetic field LFEM 1, on solidification in the hot-top Direct-
Chill DC casting of round aluminium alloy billets. The volume averaged equations
and the rigid solid phase assumption are assumed for fluid flow and heat
transfer . The electromagnetic induction equation for the field imposed by the
coil is solved using the diffuse approximate method DAM, structured in axial
symmetry with Gaussian weight function, 6 polynomial basis and 9 nodded domains.
The heat, mass, and momentum transfer equations are solved in primitive
variables by meshless method using 5 nodded domains of influence and 5 scaled
multiquadrics radial basis functions, using collocation. Explicit time stepping
is used. Pressure-velocity coupling is performed by the fractional step method.
The effects of intensity and frequency of the LFEM on the velocity and
temperature fields is investigated. A comparison of the calculated results with
different LFEM field process variables with that of the conventional hot-top DC
casting process indicates that the velocity patterns, the temperature profiles,
and the shape of the sump could be modified remarkably.

The influence of the casting parameters and of the surface quality on magnetic
and magnetoelastic properties of the amorphous Co21Fe64B15 alloy. The influence
of the casting parameters and of the surface quality upon DC hysteresis loops JH
and field dependence of the Young's modulus E on the applied field H was studied
for 6 mm wide ribbons of the Co21Fe64B15 amorphous alloy. Five ribbons were
prepared by melt-spinning technique with the different thermal history of the
melt. The as-cast ribbons exhibited different levels of quenched-in stresses and
different surface topology, as determined by surface profiling and optical
microscopy. A correlation was found between the thermal history of the melt and
the surface topology of the ribbons. The as-quenched ribbons were stress-
relieved at 2 h in vacuum and after the stress-relief DC JH and EH curves were
measured. The coercivity and the magnitude of E -effect increased and the
initial susceptibility decreased with increasing surface roughness. There was,
however, found no correlation between surface roughness and saturation
magnetostriction of the stress-relieved samples. The annealing in transverse
magnetic field 265 C2 h 358 kA m 1 in vacuum removed almost all differences
between materials, excepting the material with the worst surface quality.

High-temperature stability of postgrowth-annealed Al-doped MgxZn1-xO films
without the phase separation effect. This study investigates the effects of

/19/5/wt. % target. This study measures and reports the Hall results, x-ray
diffraction XRD, transmittance, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS data.
XRD results show that the ZnO002 and MgO2002 wurtzite peaks in addition to the
111-cubic peak disappeared after annealing. This indicates the coexistence of
two phases in the as-grown AMZO films rebuilt after higher thermal treatment.
The absorption edges of these as-grown AMZO films shifted toward the short
wavelength of 323nm under 80% transmittance, implying that band gaps can be
tuned by changing the Mg content of the AMZO layer. The XPS spectra of AMZO
films were also used to analyze the composition of the as-grown and annealed

A spectroscopic and thermal investigation into the relationship between
composition, secondary structure and physical characteristics of electrospun
zein nanofibers. Electrospun zein nanofibers have attracted interest as drug
delivery systems due to their propensity for controlled drug release, flexible
structure and low toxicity. However, comparatively little is known regarding the
relationship between production method and fiber characteristics, both in terms
of fiber architecture and protein structure. Here we use a range of imaging and
spectroscopic techniques to elucidate the effects of solvent composition on zein
secondary structure, fiber diameter and fiber integrity, plus we utilize the new
technique of transition temperature microscopy to examine the thermal properties
of the fibers. Zein nanofibers were prepared using ethanol, acetic acid and
water mixes as solvents, alone and with plasticizers polyethylene glycol,
glycerol and casein. Electrospinning was performed under controlled conditions
and the products characterized using scanning electron microscopy SEM,
attenuated total reflection Fourier Transform infrared spectrometry ATR - FTIR
and transition temperature microscopy TTM. The choice of solvent, concentration
and voltage, alongside the presence of additives plasticizers and casein were
noted to influence both the diameter of the fibers and the tendency for bead
formation. A relationship was noted between protein secondary structure and
fiber architecture, with an enhanced -sheet content, enhanced by the inclusion
of casein, being associated with higher beading. In addition, thermal imaging of
electrospun zein fiber mats was successfully achieved using TTM via two
dimensional mapping of the softening temperatures across the spun samples, in
particular demonstrating the plasticizing effects of the polyethylene glycol and
glycerol.

mechanical behavior in Fe, we propose a new atomistic description of -Fe which
is an improvement over existing models that do not consider explicitly the
magnetic interactions. The proposal is to combine a many-body potential fitted
to a database of ab-initio electronic structure calculations with a Stoner model
treatment of itinerant ferromagnetism. Using selected results on deformation
behavior from the literature, we illustrate the kind of material strength
studies that can benefit from the new description, as well as other significant
applications which are beyond the capabilities of first-principles approach.

Deformation and phase transformation behaviors of a high Nb-containing TiAl
alloy compressed at intermediate temperatures. The o o phases precipitate within
the equiaxed 2 phase during deformation. The o phase forms in the lamellae and
undergoes further deformation. The precipitation of the o phase is suppressed by
DRX. In modern -solidified TiAl alloys, the decomposition of 2 phase is
frequently observed during heat treatment or high-temperature deformation of the
alloys. In this study, high-temperature deformation and decomposition mechanisms
of 2 phase in a Ti-45Al-8.5Nb-0.2B-0.2W-0.02Y alloy are investigated. In a
sample deformed at, the precipitation of o o phase is observed within the
equiaxed 2 phase. The nucleation of o particles within the o matrix indicates
the 2 o o transformation. In addition, numerous phase precipitates form within
the o areas. The 2 lamellae decompose into ultrafine 2 + lamellae and coarsened
lamellae via 2 2 + and 2 transformation, respectively. Moreover, the o phase
nucleates within the ultrafine lamellae via 2 o transformation. However, in a
sample deformed at, the nucleation of o particles is sluggish, which is caused
by the efficient release of the internal stress via dynamic recrystallization
DRX. These results indicate that complex phase transformations can be introduced
by the decomposition of 2 phase in TiAl alloys with a high amount of
-stabilizing elements.

First principles calculations of the electronic, dynamical, and thermodynamic
properties of the rocksalt ScX X=N, P, Sb. We have investigated the electronic,
dynamical, and thermodynamic properties of the rocksalt ScX X=N, P, Sb using a
plane-wave pseudopotential method within the generalized gradient approximation
in the frame of density functional perturbation theory. The calculated lattice
constants are found to differ by less than 0.56% from the available experimental
values. These materials have the indirect X band gaps and a wide and direct band
gap at the X -point in band structure, which are closer to experimental results
than the previous calculations. A linear-response approach is used to calculate
the phonon frequencies, the phonon density of states and LOTO splitting. The
obtained phonon frequencies at the zone-center -point for the Raman-active and
infrared-active modes are analyzed. We also calculate the thermodynamic
functions using the phonon density of states, and the calculated values are in
nearly perfect agreement with experimental data.

12-Tungstophosphoric acid/BEA zeolite composites Characterization and
application for pesticide removal. Tungstophosphoric acid and BEA zeolite
composites were synthesized by wetness impregnation, followed by ultrasonication
and calcination. Composites were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, thermal
analysis and pH-dependent zeta potential. Spectroscopic measurements indicated
the interaction of acid and the support by binding of polyanion terminal oxygens
and BEA extra framework H + via hydrogen bonds. Evaluation of prepared
composites revealed their higher efficiency in nicosulfuron adsorption, in
comparison to parent zeolite. All prepared composites showed excellent
adsorption properties for pesticide removal in the range 12.125.8mg of
nicosulfuron per gram of investigated sample. Better adsorption capacity was
found for sonicated samples in comparison to as-synthesized and calcined ones.
It was found that the amount of polyanion in the composites and the extent of
the particles surface charge are not crucial for the adsorption application, it
is rather the uniformity of the zeolite surface coverage with the polyanion that
is was more important.

Improved representations of misorientation information for grain boundary
science and engineering. For every class of polycrystalline materials, the
scientific study of grain boundaries as well as the increasingly widespread
practice of grain boundary engineering rely heavily on visual representation for
the analysis of boundary statistics and their connectivity. Traditional methods
of grain boundary representation drastically simplify misorientations into
discrete categories such as coincidence vs. non-coincidence boundaries, special
vs. general boundaries, and low- vs. high-angle boundaries. Such rudimentary
methods are used either because there has historically been no suitable
mathematical structure with which to represent the relevant grain boundary
information, or, where there are existing methods they are extremely unintuitive
and cumbersome to use. This review summarizes recent developments that
significantly advance our ability to represent a critical part of the grain
boundary space: the misorientation information. Two specific topics are reviewed
in detail, each of which has recently enjoyed the development of an intuitive
and rigorous framework for grain boundary representation: i the mathematical and
graphical representation of grain boundary misorientation statistics, and ii
colorized maps or micrographs of grain boundary misorientation. At the outset,
conventions for parameterization of misorientations, projections of
misorientation information into lower dimensions, and sectioning schemes for the
misorientation space are established. Then, the recently developed
hyperspherical harmonic formulation for the description of orientation
distributions is extended to represent grain boundary statistics. This allows an
intuitive representation of the distribution functions using the axisangle
parameterization that is physically related to the boundary structure. Finally,
recently developed coloring schemes for grain boundaries are presented and the
color legends for interpreting misorientation information are provided. This
allows micrographs or maps of grain boundaries to be presented in a colorized
form which, at a glance, reveals all of the misorientation information in an
entire grain boundary network, as well as the connectivity among different
boundary misorientations. These new and improved methods of representing grain
boundary misorientation information are expected to be powerful tools for grain
boundary network analysis as the practice of grain boundary engineering becomes
a routine component of the materials design paradigm.

Experimental study and modeling of atomic-scale friction in zigzag and armchair
lattice orientations of MoS2. Physical properties of two-dimensional materials,
such as graphene, black phosphorus, molybdenum disulfide MoS2 and tungsten
disulfide, exhibit significant dependence on their lattice orientations,
especially for zigzag and armchair lattice orientations. Understanding of the
atomic probe motion on surfaces with different orientations helps in the study
of anisotropic materials. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive model that
can describe the probe motion mechanism. In this paper, we report a tribological
study of MoS2 in zigzag and armchair orientations. We observed a characteristic
power spectrum and friction force values. To explain our results, we developed a
modified, two-dimensional, stick-slip Tomlinson model that allows simulation of
the probe motion on MoS2 surfaces by combining the motion in the Mo layer and S
layer. Our model fits well with the experimental data and provides a theoretical
basis for tribological studies of two-dimensional materials.

to calcite in the heat treated nacre and from aragonite to calcium oxide CaO in
the heat treated nacre. The brick-mortar architecture remains in the heat
treated nacre, but loses in the heat treated nacre. The heat treatment burned
out the biopolymer in nacre. Nanoscale holes were discovered at the aragonite
platelet boundaries and on the platelet surfaces. The heat treated nacre
exhibits a sharp loss in elastic modulus and hardness compared with the fresh
nacre.

Nanomaterial Labels in Lateral Flow Immunoassays for Point-of-Care-Testing.
Lateral flow immunoassayshave been developed rapidly in recent years and used in
a wide range of application at point-of-care-testing POCT, where small
biomolecules can be conveniently examined on a test strip. Compared with other
biochemical detection methods such as ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay or
mass spectrometry method,have the advantages of low cost, easy operation and
short time-consuming. However, it suffers from low sensitivity since
conventional LFIA can only realize qualitative detection based on colorimetric
signals. With the increasing demand for more accurate and sensitive
determination, novel nanomaterials have been used as labels indue to their
unique advantages in physical and chemical properties. Colloidal gold,
fluorescent nanoparticles, SERS-active nanomaterials, magnetic nanoparticles and
carbon nanomaterials are utilized into produce different kinds of signals for
quantitative or semi-quantitative detection. This review paper first gives a
description of the LFIA principles, and then focuses on the state-of-the-art
nanomaterial labelling technology in At last, the conclusion and outlook are
given to inspire exploration of more advanced nanomaterials for the development

Monolithic calcium phosphate/polylactic acid composite versus calcium phosphate-
coated polylactic acid for support of osteogenic differentiation of human
mesenchymal stromal cells. Calcium phosphates CaPs, extensively used synthetic
bone graft substitutes, are often combined with other materials with the aim to
overcome issues related to poor mechanical properties of most CaP ceramics. Thin
ceramic coatings on metallic implants and polymer-ceramic composites are
examples of such hybrid materials. Both the properties of the CaP used and the
method of incorporation into a hybrid structure are determinant for the
bioactivity of the final construct. In the present study, a monolithic composite
comprising nano-sized CaP and polylactic acid PLA and a CaP-coated PLA were
comparatively investigated for their ability to support proliferation and
osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stromal
cells hMSCs. Both, the PLA/CaP composite, produced using physical mixing and
extrusion and CaP-coated PLA, resulting from a biomimetic coating process at
near-physiological conditions, supported proliferation of hMSCs with highest
rates at PLA/CaP composite. Enzymatic alkaline phosphatase activity as well as
the mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2, osteopontin and osteocalcin
were higher on the composite and coated polymer as compared to the PLA control,
while no significant differences were observed between the two methods of
combining CaP and PLA. The results of this study confirmed the importance of CaP
in osteogenic differentiation while the exact properties and the method of
incorporation into the hybrid material played a less prominent role.

microstructure, mechanical properties and thermal shock resistance of the
composites. With the increased content of BN, the Vickers hardness, flexural
strength and fracture toughness of the ZrO23YBN composites exhibited a gradual

showed that the critical thermal shock temperature T C of ZrO23Y was only;
however, it was increased to be more than and for ZrO23Y-20BN and ZrO23Y-40BN,
respectively. Improvement of thermal shock resistance for the ZrO23YBN

Modulation of electric behavior by position-dependent substitutional impurity in
zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbon. We investigate the electronic properties of
symmetric zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbon ZGNR in the presence of nitrogen N
substitutional doping by ab initio density functional theory. The transformation
energies indicate that the impurity prefers to distribute near the edges. With
N-doping moving from edge to center, the electronic transport properties are
mainly governed by holes and carriers, respectively. The charge transfer induced
by substitutional doping is analyzed in detail and the influences of doping on
the electronic transport properties of the defective nanostructure have been
discussed. Our results suggest thattransport properties can be tuned via
tailoring the atomic structures in terms of selective doping profiles, which
would be helpful for designing graphene nanoribbon GNR-based nanoelectronic
devices in future.

Initiation Strength Properties of Ring Crack Caused by Sphere Indentation in
Damage-Tolerant Advanced Pore-Free SiC. Sphere indentation tests were performed
to clarify damage properties on surface of Advanced Pore-Free SiC APF-SiC with
excellent damage tolerance. The ring crack initiation strength properties were
discussed from fracture mechanics viewpoint based on FEM analysis and detailed
observations of growth behaviors of the ring crack and the cone crack.compared
to conventional SiC, the initiation strength was nearly equal to regardless of
sphere sizes. However, its scatter was increased with increasing sphere sizes.
Clusters are formed by uniting some in multi-micro cracks which occur near
surface with increasing the contact load, one of that from which the ring crack
occurs. Therefore, the strength and the scatter are controlled by the cluster
size and its distribution, and the size depends on the generating crack density.
It can be explained by the mechanics model which is expressed by the
relationship between strength ratio and crack density based on the energy
equilibrium theory.

Peptide functionalized poly ethylene glycol-poly caprolactone nanomicelles for
specific cabazitaxel delivery to metastatic breast cancer cells. Metastatic
cancer is responsible for 90% of deaths in world. Usage of nano-carriers improve
the delivery and efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. Recent studies suggest
that decoration of the surface of nano-carriers with various targeting agents
may further improve their overall therapeutic efficacy. Using specified peptides
in targeted drug delivery is a key point in recent researches. In this study,
tumor metastasis targeting TMT homing peptide was applied as a targeting group
to improve specific drug delivery to tumor cells. TMT peptide is conjugated to
poly ethylene glycol-poly caprolactone PEG-PCL micellar nanoparticles as
carriers for targeted delivery of cabazitaxel to metastatic breast cancer cells.
Synthesis of PEG-PCL copolymer was performed by amidation reaction between
carboxylic acid group of PEG and amine group of PCL. Nanomicelles were prepared
via solvent evaporation method. TMT peptide was covalently conjugated onto
nanomicelles through the amine group of PEG. TMT-PEG-PCL nanoparticles were
analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR, scanning electron
microscope SEM, dynamic light scattering DLS, gel permeation chromatography GPC
and nuclear magnetic resonance NMR. Toxicity and cellular uptake of nanomicelles
were investigated by in vitro cytotoxicity assays and confocal scanning
microscopy in MCF-7 non-metastatic breast cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 metastatic
breast cancer cells. The final nanomicelles had about 110nm mean size and
encapsulation efficiency of 82.5%. Treatment of metastatic breast cancer cells
with targeted nanomicelles significantly increased the necrosis rate to 65%,
compared to 33% in non-targeted nanomicelles and 8% in control group. The MDA-
MB-231 cells treated with targeted nanomicelles exhibited a strong increase in
the fluorescence intensity of coumarin in comparison to the cells treated with
non-targeted nanomicelles p<0.001. It could be concluded that the present
carrier has the potential to be considered in treatment of metastatic breast
cancer cells.

Influence of grain size and texture on the cyclic stress-strain response of
nickel. The cyclic stress-strain behavior of fine-grain 24 m nickel was compared
with previously published results on coarse-grain 290 m nickel to evaluate the
effects of grain size on cyclic hardening. The fine-grain nickel exhibited a
moderate 111100 fiber texture, while the coarse-grain material was essentially
texture free.a result, texture also influenced the cyclic responses. Fatigue
experiments were conducted at plastic strain amplitudes ranging from 2.5 10 5 to
2.5 10 3 . At a plastic strain amplitude of 2.5 10 5 , the cyclic responses of
the two types of materials were nearly identical. Above that plastic strain
amplitude the fine-grain-textured specimens exhibited higher saturation
stresses. The difference became greaster plastic strain amplitude increased. The
higher saturation stress in the fine-grain-textured material was primarily
caused by a higher back stress. Both grain sizes exhibited cyclic stress-strain
curve plateaux extending from plastic strain amplitudes of 2 10 4 to 8 10 4 .
The results are discussed in terms of traditional monotonic Hall-Petch
mechanisms and the cyclic stress-strain behavior of multiple-and single-slip-
oriented single crystals.

pressure die casting aluminum alloy wheel,genetic algorithm is applied to the
optimization of process parameters. Based on casting simulation results,the BP
network is employed to build up the nonlinear mapping relationship between
process parameters and control objectives,and then the optimization of
parameters is realized by using genetic algorithm. A lowpressure die casting
A356 aluminum alloy wheel is studied as an instance,and the parameters such as
casting temperature,upper die temperature,bottom die temperature,mold core
temperature and so on are optimized. Results show that this approach is
effective to optimize the process parameters and control the porosity defect and
solidification time,which can improve the casting process.

Rapid nano-scale surface modification on micro-arc oxidation coated titanium by
microwave-assisted hydrothermal process. Nano to submicron scaled surface
possesses excellent biological affinity and several processes have been
undertaken to develop titanium implant with specific surface chemical and phase
composition and nano-scale features. A simple process was used to modify the
nano topographies on a micro-arc-oxidation MAO surface which shortens the time
for the conventional hydrothermal process HT. Nano-scaled anatase precipitates
on the MAO surface with different crystallinities and morphologies were
regulated via microwave-assisted hydrothermal in pure water MWDD or in pH
conditioned mediums containing calcium and phosphorus ions MWCP, MWCP9, MWCP11.
The surface morphologies and structures were investigated by SEM, XRD, FTIR, and
TEM. Anatase crystals as nano-spikes along 001 direction were observed on the
surface of the MWDD and MWCP groups. Increasing the pH of the conditioned medium
leads the precipitate to lose its crystallinity; the surface of MWCP11 is
covered with amorphous anatase which has a 3D nano-sheet architecture. The MW
treated surfaces possess superior hydrophilicity can adsorb more proteins
fibronectin and bovine serum albumin, and the osteoblasts-like MG63 cells on
these surfaces have higher spreading ratios than on the MAO and HT groups. The
cell viabilities in the MW groups were significantly higher than in the MAO and
HT groups on the 7th day P < 0.05, although their cell viabilities were similar
on the first day. MWCP and MWCP11 have higher alkaline phosphatase activity on
days 7 and 14 compared to other groups P < 0.05. The MW treatment produces
different nanomorphologies on the MAO surface and retains the original
micro/submicron pores and surface calcium and phosphorus contents, thus it is
expected to promote osseointegration without compromising the bond strength.

Metallo-Thermo-Mechanical Simulation of Laser-Quenching Process of Carbon Steel
by Pulsed YAG Laser Beam.. Measurements of temperature variation and residual
stress during and after laser-quenching operation are difficult due to too small
area of the referred region and too short time of the operation. This motivates
the importance of the numerical simulation treated in this paper. The CAE system
HEARTS developed based on the metallo-thermo-mechanics, the validity and
accuracy of which had already been confirmed elsewhere, is applied to the
simulation of the quenching process of a carbon steel S45C by pulsed YAG laser
beam in order to evaluate the coupled fields of phase transformation,
temperature and stress. The results of the simulated stress distribution seem to
represent the practical mode of shear stress on the quenched boundary, and the
shape of the martensite transformed region is compared with the observed
micrograph.

Microstructural effects on central crack formation in hot cross-wedge-rolled
high-strength steel parts. Central cracking in cross-wedge-rolled workpieces
results in high wastage and economic loss. Recent cross-wedge rolling tests on
two batches of steel showed that one batch formed central cracks, while the
other was crack-free. The batches were both nominally of the same chemical
composition and thermomechanical treatment history. In addition, both batches
had passed all the standard quality assessments set for conventional forging
processes. It was suspected that the different cracking behaviours were due to
differences in microstructure between the two as-received steel billets, and the
material in cross-wedge rolling CWR was more sensitive to the initial
microstructure compared with other forging processes due to its specific loading
condition including ostensibly compression and large plastic strain.
Nevertheless, no previous study of this important problem could be identified.
The aim of this study is, therefore, to identify the key microstructural
features determining the central crack formation behaviour in CWR. The hot
workability of the as-received billets was studied under uniaxial tensile
conditions using a Gleeble 3800 test machine. Scanning electron microscope with
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron backscatter diffraction was
applied to characterise, quantitatively analyse, and compare the chemical
composition, phase, grain, and inclusions in these two billets, both at room
temperature and also at the CWR temperature 1080 C. Non-metallic inclusions
oxides, sulphides, and silicates in the billets were determined to be the main
cause of the reported central cracking problem. The ductility of the steels at
both room and elevated temperatures deteriorated markedly in the presence of the
large volumes of inclusions. Grain boundary embrittlement occurred at the CWR
temperature due to the aggregation of inclusions along the grain boundaries. It
is suggested that a standard on specifying the inclusion quantity and size in
CWR billets be established to produce crack-free products.

Ultrathin barium titanate films by polyol thermal decomposition process. We have
successfully fabricated barium titanate BaTiO3 films on Si100 and
Pt111/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates using the polyol thermal decomposition PTD process
by spin-coating technique. InPTD process, we confirmed that the crystalline
oxycarbonate Ba2Ti2O5CO3 films were directly formed as a consequence of
evaporation of polyol precursor solution prepared simply by mixing metal
chlorides and ethylene glycol, and then converting them into crystalline BaTiO3
films through thermal decomposition at >500 C. This feature makes it possible to
grow densely packed and crack-free BaTiO3 films as thin as 70 per cycle.
Although PTD is described here for a complex metal-oxide film of BaTiO3, other
simple and complex metal-oxide thin films with high-dielectric constant
materials are also likely to be suitable for deposition with accurate control of
film thickness and composition using the polyol precursor solutions.

XRD spectra of new YBaCuO superconductors. XRD spectra of new YBaCuO
superconductors were studied. There were 2 phases found in our samples, the
superconducting phase and the non-superconducting phase. The more non-
superconducting phase, the more anisotropy parameters were found. The amount of
impurities have no effect on the value of c-axis which has a linear relation to
the number of Cu-atoms. So the new formula of YBaCuO are the new types of
superconductor in this family that have higher c-axis than the Y123.

Preparation of PAN Spinning Solution with Fine Dispersion of Cellulose
Microparticles. This study suggested the optimum conditions for the stable
dispersion of cellulose microparticles in PAN spinning dope, which was prepared
for spinning the fiber. Many research studies have investigated methods for
preparing a variety of carbon fiber precursors in an attempt to control their
characteristics according to the applications. In order to prepare PAN fiber
that contains fine cellulose particles, it is important to create a uniformly
dispersed spinning dope. Minimization of the cellulose particle size was
subjected to heat treatment at various temperatures in order to reduce the
cohesive force from the hydrogen bonds between the cellulose molecules.
Carbonized cellulose microparticles were obtained for efficient dispersion using
the physical method and the sedimentation method. Several instrumental analyses
were conducted to study the characteristics of the particles and solutions with
SEM, FT-IR, XRD, and a particle size analyzer. From the results, the dispersion
of the PAN spinning dope with a chemical treatment was superior to the milling
method followed by heat treatment. In this study, heat-treating cellulose
microparticles at was found to be the most effective method.

Crimped Fiber Printing via E-Jetting for Tissue Engineering. A regular pattern
called crimp is an essential morphological feature of collagen fibers in native
tendon. In this study, the direct crimp writing DCW and zig-zag pattern writing
ZPW were developed based on electrohydrodynamic jet printing E-jetting process
to fabricate the crimped fibers. For the DCW process, the fibers were deposited
with the linear movement of stage, and the crimps crimp angle: 46; crimp length:
630 m; fiber diameter: 100 m were formed from the spinning of fibers. For the
ZPW process, the fibers was printed via the zig-zag moving path, and the effects
of a vital process parameter i.e. dwell time on the fiber characteristics were
investigated to obtain controllable and regular crimped fibers. The result of
mechanical testing showed that the ZPW fibers exhibited the toe and linear
regions with different Youngs modulus 4 1 MPa and 23 4 MPa, respectively, while
DCW fibers were found only with linear region. Compared with DCW process, the
ZPW process was able to fabricate crimped fibers in a more controllable pathway.
The human tenocytes were also seeded on the ZPW fibers to investigate the
cellular alignment. This study suggested that ZPW process was capable of
printing crimped fibers which mimicked the fiber profile in human tendon, and
has the potential in scaffold fabrication for tendon tissue engineering.

observed by measuring electric hysteresis loops. The film on LaNiO3 bottom
electrodes has the largest double remnant polarization 6.61 iC/cm2. The remnant
polarizations are 4.14iC/cm2 and 4.53iC/cm2 for the films on ITO and Pt

Hierarchy structure and fracture mechanisms of the wild wolf tusk's enamel. The
self-growth and self-strengthening of natural biomaterials provided us
strategies for new materials design. In this paper, the microstructure and
fracture mechanisms of the wild wolf tusk's enamel were studied. The enamel
included four-order hierarchies, which were the hydroxyapatite HAP fiber first-
order, nano-scale, ploy-crystals, enamel rod second-order, micro-scale, rope-
like, enamel type third-order, meso-scale, mat-like and the enamel patterns
forth-order, macro-scale, respectively. It was interesting to find that the
numerous nano-grains distributed disorderly in a single HAP fiber. The thousands
HAP fibers bundled together to form the rope-like enamel rod. The protein
ligaments were discovered between adjacent enamel rods. The out enamel, inner
enamel and P&D-zones showed a criss-cross type and ran through whole enamel
pattern in three-dimensional space. The enamel of the wild wolf tusk exhibited
an excellent fracture toughness based on the nanoindentation tests. The fracture
morphology in transverse direction indicated that the cracks preferred to
propagate along the weak interface protein or interrod and cut those enamel rods
perpendicular to the propagation direction. However, the cracks extended
obviously forward along the step-like paths from the outmost surface of the
enamel to the enamel-dentin junction in the longitudinal direction. It was
considered that the protein ligament was the main reason for the good fracture
toughness of the bulk enamel. Our studies reveal that the design strategies of
the natural material can be applied to guide the development of high-performance
artificial materials.

Determination of Residual Stress of Low Carbon Steel Plates by X-Rays. During
the recent years, much progress has been made in the metallurgical field, more
particularly in investigation to detemine with X-rays the internal stress of
metals and in the accuracy of its detection with the improved experimental
procedure and the equipment for measusement of stress with X-rays. But, there
are some problems relative to the microstress obtained by X-rays and the
macrostress by mechanical methods.Considerable agreement of both the stresses in
the macro-elastic range is recognized. In the measurement of residual stress in
the material subject to plastic deformation the diffraction plane dependency,
the broadening of the diffraction pattern, Gefugespannungen etc. are important
factors in the measurement of stress with X-rays to determine the residual
lattice strains of certain grains in the specimen selectively. Many
investigators pointed out that, after uniaxial plastic deformation, the surface
of metals shows residual compressive stress, the so-called surface effect.These
factors must be considered even in determining the surface stress by X-rays in
the low carbon steel after various plastic detormation. At each stage after the
uniaxial plastic deformation, the residual stress obtained by the lattice
strains determined by the diffraction lines of the310, 211 and 220 planes using
Cok1, CrK1 and FeK1, respectively on the surface of the low carbon steel plates
is compressive, and increases rapidly up to plastic strain e6%, and thereafter
increases slowly. The breadth of the diffraction line increases correspondently
to the residual stress. The residual axial stress distributed over the cross
section of the plate was determined by means of etching, and measured by X-rays
or by strain gauge. The results showed that the compressive residual stress on
the surface layers balanced to the tensile stress in the interior of the
specimen when we used strain gauge, but lost balance when we used X-rays. When
the thickness of the specimen approached zero after successive etchings, the
residual compressive stress obtained by X-rays diminished, but some compressive
stress remained still on their layers. The maximum compressive stress was not
observed on the surface, but was latent in the interior near the surface. It is
considered from these results that Gefugespannungen due to the existence of the
cementite and ferrite phase seems to play an important role.In determining the
breadth of the diffraction line, measurement was made from the differential
curve of the diffraction contour by the twin pole Geiger-Muller counter as
mentioned in The Third International Conference on Non-destructive Testing 1960.
A new method is mentioned. The differential curve obtained by the twin pole
Geiger-Muller counter method shows zero on the peak position of the intensity
curve of the X-ray diffraction and a peak on the position of the maximum slope
of the intensity curve. The angle between these two positions corresponds to
half the width of the intensity curve. Thus the influence of the variation of
the intensity of the X-ray source which is one of the most serious problems in
usual counter method became small, and we could measure the width easily even
though the diffraction line was broad in the plastic deformation.

Peritectic Reactions and Phase Transformations of Sn-30wt%Cu for High
Temperature PbFree Soldering Applications. Extending the use of the SnCu system
to high-temperature solders poses additional challenges as the necessary high Cu
content is in a region of the binary phase diagram which is dominated by the
peritectic reaction and has the intermetallic compound IMC Cu3Sn as the primary
phase, which is known to have negative effects on soldering properties. Minor
additions of nickel Ni have been reported to suppress the formation of Cu3Sn in
low Cu content SnCu solder alloys though higher Cu content alloys have not been
investigated.such, the objective of this paper was to investigate the effect of
more significant concentrations of Ni on the microstructure of a Sn-30wt%Cu
alloy. An initial addition of 2wt%Ni greatly reduced the volume fractions of
Cu3Sn and the amount of eutectic present whilst significantly increasing the
volume fraction of Cu6Sn5 ; however, further additions of Ni had a less
pronounced affect. The Sn-30wt%Cu morphology was changed from a plate-like
structure to a dendritic structure by adding Ni, which would improve solder
performance by decreasing the possible crack plane length.

Coercivity and domain structure of nanograined FeC alloys after high-pressure
torsion. The microstructure and magnetic properties of binary hypo- and hyper-
eutectoid FeC alloys were studied. The investigations have been carried out on
the samples in the as-cast state, after a long annealing at and on the specimens
after the high-pressure torsion HPT. The deformation was carried out at the
ambient temperature and the pressure of 5GPa. The grain size after HPT is in the
nanometer range. Long annealing leads to a drastic decrease of the coercivity in
comparison with the as-cast alloys. In all alloys the coercivity Hc increases
with increasing carbon content. The distance L between pinning points for domain
walls decreases with increasing carbon content. Increase of the coercivity and
decrease of L are more pronounced below the eutectoid concentration. The
coercivity of the nanostructured samples is higher than that of the as-cast
alloys. Due to the pinning of domain walls by the cementite particles, the
hysteresis loop in the coarse-grained alloys both in as-cast and annealed states
has a narrowing near the zero magnetization.

Effects of tungsten carbide on electrochemical properties of composite inert
anodes. In search of a anodic material used in zinc electrowinning in place of
Pb- Ag alloy,Al /Pb/- PbO2WC composite inert anodes on the surface of aluminum
alloy substrates were prepared by pulse electrodeposition from a bath,the
effects of WC concentrations in a original plating bath on the electrochemical
properties of the composite inert anodes were researched in a synthetic zinc
electrowinning simulated solution,and the anodic polarization curves,Tafel
polarization curves and cyclic voltammetry curves were measured. The results
show that the oxygen evolution overpotential of Al /Pb/- PbO2- WC composite
inert anodes firstly decrease and then increase with the increasing of WC
concentrations in a original plating bath,and the best electrocatalytic activity
of oxygen evolution is obtained under the WC concentration of 30 g/L. Compared
with Al /Pb/- PbO2 composite inert anode and Pb- 1% Ag alloy,the oxygen
evolution overpotentials of Al /Pb/- PbO2- WC composite inert anodes reduce 67

Examination of SHPB Type Impact Fracture Toughness Testing Method by Dynamic
Finite Element Analysis. Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar SHPB technique has been
used to evaluate dynamic fracture toughness values of metals, polymers and
composites. There are some attempts for such SHPB toughness testing that
conventional static equation is applied to evaluate toughness under high speed
loading condition by introducing gradually increasing load to the specimen. In
this study, dynamic finite element analysis was performed to simulate SHPB type
toughness testing with use of rubber buffer. A 2-D model including viscoelastic
behavior of polymer specimen was developed, and it was found that the dynamic
behavior experimentally obtained was well simulated using the model. Limitation
of the use of the static analysis for impact toughness evaluation was also
examined by considering acceleration effect on the stress intensity factor. The
analytical result exhibited that the applicability of the static analysis may be
assessed by considering the effect of acceleration on each of the test
configurations.

Influence of High Hydration Temperature at Early Age on the Strength Development
of High Strength Concretes with and without Silica Fume.. High strength concrete
with the compressive strength in excess of 80MPa has recently been a matter of
concern in its application to the column or core wall of high-rise reinforced
concrete building. High strength concrete can potentially generate high
hydration temperature at early ages due to its relatively high cement conctent.
It has been pointed out that a high temperature profile at early ages has a
detrimental effect on the strength of high strength concrete, reducing long-term
strength development and increasing thermal cracking risk.In this study, a
temperature matched curing system TMC which can simulate in-situ temperature
profiles of the column was developed in order to investigate the influence of
high hydration temperature at early ages on the strength development of high
strength concretes with and without silica fume. It was found that under sealed
conditions, a high temperature of at early ages in high strength concretes with
silica fume led to a little higher 7-day strength but no increase in strength
beyond 28 days, whilst it had no significant detrimental effect on the strength
development in those without silica fume. The evaporable and non-evaporable
water content data showed that both the hydration of cement and the pozzolanic
reaction of silica fume almost completed after 3 days TMC due to the shortage of
water in concrete when high strength concretes with silica fume were subjected
to a high temperature of at early ages.

Role of the crystallographic texture in anisotropic mechanical properties of a
newly-developed hot-rolled TRIP steel. In general, hot-rolled steels have higher
strength but lower ductility in the transverse direction. In this work, the
effects of the crystallographic texture on the anisotropic tensile properties of
a new hot-rolled TRIP steel, named DF-TRIP steel, were investigated by electron
backscatter diffraction. The tensile tests showed that the hot-rolled steel
exhibited nearly the same yield strength but different TRIP effects when loaded
along the rolling direction and transverse direction. The low anisotropy in
yield strength was explained by the negligible difference in rolling texture in
the ferrite due to strain-induced dynamic ferrite transformation. However, a
lower Taylor factor of the austenite was found along the rolling direction,
leading to early onset of slip and thus providing nucleation sites for strain-
induced martensitic transformation. This new hot-rolled steel shows higher
ultimate strength and better total uniform elongation in the rolling direction.

Simulation of Al and phosphorus diffusion gettering in Si. We present a
quantitative computer model Gettering Simulator of phosphorus diffusion
gettering PDG that allows to simulate the PDG process. The model was checked for
Au as a typical substitutional metallic impurity elements and for Co as an
example of the fast diffusing interstitial 3d metals in Si. Here we will only
discuss the gettering of substitutional metals. The Gettering Simulator includes
a model for P diffusion for phosphorus concentrations P up to the solubility
limit. In this model, the main contribution to phosphorus diffusion at P<210 19
cm 3 comes from the kick-out mechanism, while at higher P concentrations the
diffusion is dominated by phosphorus vacancy complexes. The latter results in
the development of the well-known kink-and-tail P and specific self-interstitial
profiles. The gettering mechanism is described by a combination of three
factors: 1 the Fermi level effect; 2 the formation of phosphorusmetal pairs; 3
the high concentration of self-interstitials in the bulk together with nearly
equilibrium concentration in the region of high phosphorus concentration near
the surface. The third factor was found to be very important for the PDG of
substitutional metals. No local equilibrium is assumed in the model. Instead.
the calculations are based on the reaction rates between different species.

Effect of buffer layer structure on electrical and structural properties of

transistorswith similar active layers structures were grown on SiC or sapphire
substrates using different buffer layer structures, including GaN of different
thickness 1 or 2m or composite AlGaN/GaN buffers. The highest density of hole
traps was observed in the buffer on sapphire, while the lowest density of hole
traps was obtained in the thick 2m GaN buffer on SiC. The reverse leakage
currents inwere lower in the devices grown on SiC substrates and the on-off
ratios improved by two orders of magnitude for thicker GaN buffers or composite
AlGaN/GaN buffers compared to a standard 1m GaN buffer. The maximum drain-source

Strength characteristics of concrete exposed to the elevated temperatures
according to the temperature-time curve ISO834 . While exposed to high
temperatures caused by fire, the concrete undergoes a sequence of physical and
chemical structure changes causing a mechanical degradation. This paper concerns
an experimental strength determination of a temperature stressed concrete. The
concrete was temperature loaded according to temperature-time curve ISO834 and
left on a top temperature level for 60 minutes afterwards. This temperature
heating rise is in accordance with a common fire expansion in a structure. The
concrete panels sized 150 1300 2300 mm were temperature loaded up to 550, 600,
800 a in a horizontal position in gas furnace for fire testing of structure
elements in research Centre AdMaS. The temperatures of the gas in the furnace
and the panel was measured during the whole experiment by using the
thermocouples. After the fire test, the specimens were drilled out using a 100
mm diameter core drill. The compressive strength and splitting tensile strength
tests were made and the results were compared to the reference specimens test
results. The objective results of a commonly used strength class concrete loaded
by elevated temperature corresponding to the real fire exposure differ common

carbon/copper composites were prepared from electrolytic copper powder, graphite
particulate and pitch coke powder through compression molding, carbonization and
impregnation. The effect of different concentrations of sodium silicate solution
on their mechanical and tribological properties was studied. The results showed
that the density of the composites increased monotonically with increasing the
concentration of the sodium silicate solution.did the bending strength and
compressive strength, and they reached maxima of 47.78 MPa and 170.06 MPa at 30
wt. % of sodium silicate, respectively. The friction coefficient and wear rate
of composite decreased monotonically with increasing the concentration of sodium
silicate due to the formation of a lubricating film. The wear mechanism of the
impregnated composites was abrasive wear accompanied by slight adhesive wear.
The netlike silicon dioxide skeleton reduced the probability of abrasive wear,

Assessment of Acoustic Emission and Triaxial Mechanical Properties of Rock-
Cemented Tailings Matrix Composites. Acoustic emission AE test is a powerful
technique for examining the sounds of cracks growing, breaking, and other modes
of damage in cementitious materials deforming under stress, such as rock-
cemented tailings matrix composites RCTMC. RCTMC, an engineered mixture of
tailings, cement, rock, and water, is widely used to fulfill numerous important
roles at underground mine sites as a construction material and a ground support
tool. To study the mechanical strength and AE properties of RCTMC, compression
testing was carried out using a triaxial compression test system TAW-2000 and AE
monitoring system PCI-2, and the failure modes of samples were also examined.
Results have shown that 1 the failure process of RCTMC samples can be divided
into six main stages: compaction, linear elastic characteristic, crack growth,
primary damage development, cemented tailings backfill withstand stress zone,
and secondary damage development stage. CTB has the strengthening effect on
mechanical strength of rock; 2 the AE process can be also divided into six main
stages: the prepeak quiescence period, the elastic energy reserve period, the
first destruction development AE area, the secondary energy reserve period, the
second damage development stage, and the postpeak calm period; and 3 samples
cumulative ring count is stepped distribution over time, and the ring count has
entered the postpeak flat stage after many active periods. The process of RCTMC
samples from tensile to shear failure mode is represented by numerical
simulation. Finally, the obtained experimental results can offer a useful
reference for the further study of the mechanism of the surrounding rock and
cemented tailings backfill structure.

effects of Al2O3 additives on the anticorrosion and tribological properties of
Mn3PO42 -coated carbon steel were investigated. The microstructure and
morphology of the coatings were studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray
diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy. The Vickers micro-hardness and wear resistance of the produced
composite coatings were evaluated and compared with those of the non-composited
Mn3PO42 coating. The electrochemical corrosion behaviors of the prepared
coatings were investigated in a 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution by a
potentiostatgalvanostat device to determine the effects of Al2O3 on the
formation of Mn3PO42 coatings on steel. Mn3PO42 composite conversion coatings
were successfully created by chemical treatment, with the main component of
hureaulite Mn,Fe5H2PO444H2O. The micro-hardness, wear resistance, corrosion
performance, and passivation behaviors of the coatings were improved by adding

coating to attain the best microstructure, wear resistance properties, and
corrosion resistance was 10 g/L.

Development of Multifunctional Materials MFM: Bioabsorbable Drug-Releasing Hard
Tissue Fixation Screws. To develop a successful bone fixation device that can
also release therapeutic agents such as antibiotics one has to consider
mechanical, drug release, and biocompatibility properties. We have used
bioabsorbable polymers PLGA 80/20/ or PLDLA 70/30/ as the matrix and
ciprofloxacin CF as antibiotic to develop such an implant. Initial shear
strengths of the studied ciprofloxacinreleasing screws were 152 MPa P/L/DLLA and
172 MPa PLGA. Studied screws retained their mechanical properties for least 12
weeks PL/DLLA and 9 weeks PLGA in vitro at the level that ensures their fixation
properties. Pull-out tests indicated that the early version of screws have lower
values as compared to controls. CF was found to be released after 44 weeks
P/L/DLLA and 23 weeks PLGA in vitro. It remained in the range of 0.06 8.7
g/ml/day for PL/DLLA and 0.6 - 11.6 g/ml/day for PLGA after the jump start.
Release CF was demonstrated to significantly inhibit S. epidermides growth,
attachment and biofilm formation different than controls. Histology showed no
difference from plain polymer screws, except for increased giant cells at the
implantation site. Accordingly, SR-PL/DLLA and SR-PLGA MF implants were
considered appropriate to proceed to pilot clinical application.

Transformation toughening explored via molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo
simulations. The microscopic mechanism of 'transformation toughening' is thought
to be the stress reduction at a crack tip resulting from a displacive phase
transformation induced by the stress field of a crack under external loading.
Whether transformation toughening or 'transformation embrittlement' is the
result depends on many different characteristics of the displacive
transformation, as well as the geometry of the stress field of the crack. Since
both crack and displacive transformation dynamics are sufficiently rapid to be
suitably simulated in a molecular dynamics scheme we have explored this approach
with the ordered intermetallic NiAl, employing embedded atom method EAM
potentials. These potentials, in turn, have allowed the construction of a
Ginzburg-Landau strain free energy functional with all the material dependent
parameters determined from molecular dynamics simulations, which may then be
used to carry out Monte Carlo simulations of the crack-transformation zone
interaction on a substantially larger spatial scale. These various types of
simulation will be described and the results analysed.

Phase field modeling of crack propagation in shape memory ceramics Application
to zirconia. A phase field model for crack propagation in shape memory ceramics
is developed. Martensitic transformation leads to unusual crack propagation
paths. Lattice orientation has significant effects on both the crack path and
toughening. Shape memory ceramicsare promising candidates for actuators in
extreme environments such as high temperature and corrosive applications.
Despite outstanding energy dissipation, compared to metallic shape memory
materials,suffer from a sudden brittle fracture. While the interaction of crack
propagation and phase transformation inhave been subject of several experimental
and theoretical studies, mainly at the macroscale, the fundamental understanding
of the dynamic interaction of crack propagation and martensitic transformation
is poorly understood. In this work, we use the phase field framework to fully
couple the martensitic transformation to the variational formulation of brittle
fracture. The model is parameterized for single crystal zirconia which
experiences tetragonal to monoclinic transformation during crack propagation.
For the mode I of fracture, the opening mode, crack shows an unusual propagation
path that is in good agreement with the experiments and indicates the
significant role of phase transformation on the crack propagation path. The
investigation on the effect of lattice orientation on crack propagation shows
that the lattice orientation has a significant influence not only on the crack
propagation path but also on the magnitude of the transformation toughening. In
a constrained crystal the maximum minimum toughening, under mode I loading,
occurs when the crystal lattice orientation makes the angle of 50 90 degrees
with the crack surface.

Scanning electron microscopy observations of insulation cork agglomerates.
Observations by scanning electron microscopy were made of insulation cork
agglomerates and of cork raw material. The insulation cork agglomerates are
agglomerates of granules of cork from the cork-oak tree Quercus suber , self-
bonded and expanded by autoclave steaming at approximately and 40 kPa. In this
process, the cork cells expand by unfolding the cell wall corrugations and by
stretching the cell walls concurrently decreasing the cell wall thickness. In
the junctions between granules, the cells are compressed against each other and
collapsed; the region of cell collapse is restricted to a limited number of cell
layers at the boyndary between the granules. The cell wall material is
thermochemically degraded and a weight loss of approximately 30% of the cork
material is observed in the production of these insulation agglomerates.

Residual stresses in environmental and thermal barrier coatings on curved

stresses within thermal barrier coated TBC systems are predicted using finite
element models and are compared against experimental measurements taken using
Raman and photo-stimulated luminescence piezo-spectroscopic methods. Two types
of specimens were considered: flat specimens without TBC, and aerofoil shaped
specimens with TBC. Comparisons between model predictions and experimentally
measured stresses and also the relationship between substrate curvature and
residual stresses on subsequent spallation of the aerofoil specimen were made.
For the flat specimen, predicted and measured residual stresses are of the same
order of magnitude. Both studies have indicated that larger compressive residual
stresses arise from higher substrate curvatures. The results improve the
understanding of initiation and propagation of TBC cracks which occurs
preferentially at locations with high substrate convex curvature.

Defect-enabled electrical current leakage in ultraviolet light-emitting diodes.
The AlGaN materials system offers a tunable, ultra-wide bandgap that is
exceptionally useful for high-power electronics and deep ultraviolet
optoelectronics. Moseley et al. pp. 723726 investigate a structural defect known
as an open-core threading dislocation or ''nanopipe'' that is particularly
detrimental to devices that employ these materials. Furthermore, an AlGaN thin
film was synthesized using metal-organic chemical-vapor deposition. Electrical
current leakage is detected at a discrete point using a conductive atomic-force
microscope CAFM. However, no physical feature or abnormality at this location
was visible by an optical microscope. The AlGaN thin film was then etched in hot
phosphoric acid, and the same location that was previously analyzed was
revisited with the CAFM. The point that previously exhibited electrical current
leakage had been decorated with a 1.1 m wide hexagonal pit, which identified the
site of electrical current leakage as a nanopipe and allows these defects to be
easily observed by optical microscopy. Moreover, with this nanopipe
identification and quantification strategy, the authors were able to correlate
decreasing ultraviolet light-emitting diode optical output power with increasing
nanopipe density.

hardening produced by annealing around results in coercivities H ci of 714 kOe.
The partial replacement of iron by cobalt plus aluminum results in a high energy
product in the as-spun state owing to the fine microstructure. When neodymium is
partially replaced by praseodymium to produce a high coercivity or when silicon
is added, glass formation is enhanced. It has been confirmed that a cost

Microstructure and mechanical behaviour of an advanced powder metallurgy nickel
base superalloy processed through hot isostatic pressing route for aerospace
applications. An advanced powder metallurgy P/M nickel-base superalloy envisaged

inert gas atomized powder. Extensive characterization of the microstructural

precipitates within austenitic -FCC matrix phase in the as-HIPed condition.
Investigation of prior particle boundary precipitatesthrough TEM and Electron
Probe Micro Analysis EPMA techniques revealed the dominance of metallic oxides
and MC type carbides. The suitability of the advanced P/M superalloy for
realizing near-net shape components by Direct-HIPing for short duration
aeroengine rotating components is assessed by evaluating the room temperature
and elevated temperature tensile behaviour as well as stress-rupture life in the
service temperature regimes. The yield strength and the ultimate tensile
strength of the present alloy at are found to be 850MPa and 1275MPa respectively
combined with 28% of ductility which is comparable to those of the similar class
of superalloys in service. On the other hand, the as-HIPed superalloy exhibited

for fabrication of near-net shape components for aerospace applications.

Effect of stress reductions on the creep behaviour and subgrain size in aluminum
deformed at. The effect of stress reductions, during steady state creep
deformation, on the strain-time and subgrain size behaviour in high purity
aluminum was studied. Stress reductions during steady state creep at produce a
reduced strain rate which slowly increases, approaching the steady state rate
which would be obtained at the reduced stress. This change in strain rate is
accompanied by an increase in subgrain size as measured by optical techniques.
The subgrain size, after deformation at the reduced stress, approaches the
steady state subgrain size at the reduced stress.

on the microstructure and mechanical properties of as-cast Al-5.5Si alloy is
studied by means of optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
hardness test and tensile test. The influence of annealing treatment on the
microstructure and properties of the AlSi alloys is also investigated as well.
The results show that the addition of Sc and Y2O3 nano-particles could
significantly improve the mechanical property of the AlSi alloy. The ultimate
tensile strength and yield strength of AlSiSc/Y2O3 alloy are improved by around
45 and 71%, respectively, when compared to that of the AlSi alloy. The effect of
the nanosized particles precipitated and added on strengthening and deformation
of AlSi alloy is analyzed and discussed in detail. The results of annealing
treatment indicate that the change in mechanical property of the AlSiSc alloy
during annealing treatment is mainly associated with the precipitation of the
secondary Si phase.

Nucleation of recrystallized grains in multiple slipped structure without
deformation band in aluminum single crystal. The characteristics of multiple
slipped structure and the nucleation of recrystallized grainshave been
investigated using pure aluminum single crystals with an initial tensile axis TA
orientation of 111 deformed in tension. By a scanning electron microscope SEM,
very short and wavy slip traces without deformation bandswere observed, in which
the maximum misorientation was only approximately 5. By a transmission electron
microscope TEM, it is found that a layered dislocation microstructure consisted
of cells with dense dislocation wallswas developed. Groups of the cells were
mutually rotated, by approximately 4, about an axis normal to the TA as if they
maintained tensile strain and compressive strain by turns. After annealing,
orientations ofwere mainly rotated at angles of over 26 about each 111 axis
normal to four kinds of {111} slip planes in each adjacent deformed matrix DM.
It is renewed in more detail that the nucleation of thewith the 111 rotation
relationship to each adjacent DM could be explained by the 111 rotation
recrystallization nucleation model. The 111 rotation relationships between the
deformation textures and the corresponding annealing textures in FCC metals are
selected in both stages of the nucleation ofas well as their growth.

Electrolytic deposition and corrosion resistance of ZnNi coatings obtained from
sulphate-chloride bath. ZnNi coatings were deposited under galvanostatic
conditions on steel substrate OH18N9. The influence of current density of
deposition on the surface morphology, chemical and phase composition was
investigated. The corrosion resistance of ZnNi coatings obtained at current
density 1025 mA cm2 are measured, and are compared with that of metallic cadmium
coating. Structural investigations were performed by the X-ray diffraction XRD
method. The surface morphology and chemical composition of deposited coatings
were studied using a scanning electron microscope JEOL JSM-6480 with EDS
attachment. Studies of electrochemical corrosion resistance were carried out in
the 5% NaCl, using potentiodynamic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
EIS methods. On the ground of these research, the possibility of deposition of
ZnNi coatings contained 2426% at. Ni was exhibited. It was stated, that surface
morphology, chemical and phase composition of these coatings are practically
independent on current density of deposition. On the basis of electrochemical
investigations it was found that corrosion resistance of these ZnNi coatings is
also independent of current density. These coatings are more corrosion resistant
in 5% NaCl solution than metallic cadmium. It was suggested that the ZnNi
coating may be used as a substitute for toxic cadmium.

Alignment of carbon nanotubes under the influences of nematic liquid crystals
and electric fields an analytical study. Carbon nanotubeshave benefits in
various fields, they are disadvantageous due to their tendency to form
aggregates and poorly controlled alignment of the CNT molecules characterized by
order parameters. These deficiencies can be overcome by dispersing thein nematic
liquid crystal LC and placing the mixture under the influence of an electric
field. In this study, Doi and Landaude Gennes free energy density equations are
used to analytically confirm that an electric field increases the order
parameters ofandin a dispersion mixture. The anchoring strength of the nematic
LC is also found to affect the order parameters of theand LC. Further,
increasing the length-to-diameter ratio of theincreases their alignment without
affecting the LC alignment. These findings indicate that CNT molecular alignment
can be controlled by adjusting the CNT length-to-diameter ratio, anchoring the
and adjusting the electric field strength.

Spinodal Decomposition in Functionally Graded Super Duplex Stainless Steel and
Weld Metal. Low-temperature phase separations T<500C, resulting in changes in
mechanical and corrosion properties, of super duplex stainless steel SDSS base
and weld metals were investigated for short heat treatment times 0.5 to 600
minutes. A novel heat treatment technique, where a stationary arc produces a
steady state temperature gradient for selected times, was employed to fabricate
functionally graded materials. Three different initial material conditions
including 2507 SDSS, remelted 2507 SDSS, and 2509 SDSS weld metal were
investigated. Selective etching of ferrite significantly decreased in regions
heat treated at to already after 3 minutes due to rapid phase separations. Atom
probe tomography results revealed spinodal decomposition of ferrite and
precipitation of Cu particles. Microhardness mapping showed that as-welded
microstructure and/or higher Ni content accelerated decomposition. The arc heat
treatment technique combined with microhardness mapping and electrolytical
etching was found to be a successful approach to evaluate kinetics of low-
temperature phase separations in SDSS, particularly at its earlier stages. A
time-temperature transformation diagram was proposed showing the kinetics of-
embrittlement in 2507 SDSS.

become an emerging field due to their safe, eco-friendly and non-toxic nature
that are suitable for synergistic biological activities. Hence, the greener
method is chosen by the present study. In the present study, the greener
synthesis of gold nanoparticles AuNPs was successfully done by using Coleus
aromaticus leaf extract at three different temperatures 30 C, and. The formation
of AuNPs was initially monitored by visual observation and then characterized
with the help of diverse techniques like UVVis spectroscopy UVVis, X-ray
diffraction XRD, Fourier transform infrared FT-IR spectroscopy, Scanning
Electron Microscopy SEM, High Resolution-Transmission Electron Microscopy HR-TEM
and dynamic light scattering DLS. Surface plasmon resonance SPR peak and
crystalline nature of AuNPs were obtained by UVVis and XRD spectroscopies
respectively. FT-IR analysis shows the different characteristic functional
groups in turn responsible for the bio-reduction of gold ions by using leaf
extract. The formations of different nano-sized AuNPs with their different
morphologies were observed by SEM and HR-TEM analyses. Surface charge and
stability of the AuNPs were measured by zeta potential and DLS respectively. The
synthesized AuNPs coated with cotton fabric was analyzed by UV-Diffuse
Reflectance Spectroscopy UV-DRS, which revealed excellent UV protection against
UV radiation. The AuNPs coated cotton fabric exhibited remarkable antibacterial
sensitivity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. Further,

Surface Characterization of DD6 Single Crystal Superalloy during Acid Etching at
Different Temperatures. An experimental study was carried out to investigate the
effect of acid etching on surface integrity of a single crystal nickelbased
superalloy. The corrosion tests were conducted in solution of hydrochloric acid
and hydrogen peroxide at different reaction temperatures. The corroded specimens
were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, weight loss measurements and
surface roughness measuring instrument. The results indicate that DD6 suffers
serious selective corrosion at cold bath temperature due to unduly slow etching
when immersed for the maximum time. It is found that preferential dissolution of
phase occurred, leading to the increase of surface roughness.

GaN-based ultraviolet light-emitting diodes with multifinger contacts. GaN-based
ultraviolet light-emitting diodes with identical contact areas but different
contact shapes are studied. Interdigitated multifinger contacts with reduced
finger width result in a lower series resistance and a thermal roll-over of the
output power at higher cw currents in comparison to square-shaped contacts.
Under pulsed operation, the external quantum efficiency in these devices is
increased due to a reduction of the efficiency droop at elevated currents.
Simulations of the current distribution explain the experimental data with an
improved uniformity of the current density in multifinger contacts as current
crowding at the contact edges is largely suppressed.

Deformation Structure and Texture Transformations in Twinned Fcc Metals:
Critical Role of Micro- and Macro- Scale Shear Bands. Microstructure and texture
development in twinned fcc metals is investigated in order to characterize the
influence of micro- and macro-scale brass-type shear bands SB on structural and
textural changes at large deformations. TEM and SEM analyses are focused on
bands developed by plane strain compression in twinned C{112}&lt;111&gt;
oriented single crystals. The proposed crystallographic model of the shear
banding phenomenon refers to the idea of local lattice reorientation within
narrow areas. Most of these rotations occur around the TD&lt;110&gt; axis with
significant further rotations about &lt;112&gt; poles. These two rotations
explain the influence ofon the formation of Goss{110}&lt;001&gt; and
brass{110}&lt;112&gt;-S{123}&lt;634&gt; texture components clearly observed in

Finite element analysis of forces of plane cutting of cortical bone. Bone
cutting is an essential part of orthopaedic surgery when bone is fractured or
damaged by a disease and is used for pins insertion and plates fixation. A
finite element model of bone cutting is developed and compared with experimental
results. The model allows the interaction between the bone and cutting tool to
be studied, hence enabling the evaluation and optimization of the cutting
procedure. Results of finite element simulations are obtained for the cutting
force as a function of cutting parameters. A strong dependence of cutting
parameters on the cutting force was found and described in this paper.

Numerical simulation of residual stress in brazing joint between cemented
carbide and steel. The values and their distribution of residual stress in
cemented carbidesteel brazing joints were studied by means of finite element
numerical simulation, and the residual stress in the joint was also calculated
when external compressive loads were exerted on the brazed specimen during the
cooling process. The results indicate that residual stress in the joint is not
uniform and has higher values in the matrix near the seam, especially in the
cemented carbide. Therefore, it is considered that the cemented carbide near the
seam will be the fracture location when the joint is broken. If a compressive
pressure of 60 MPa is exerted on the brazed specimen during the cooling process,
the residual stress in the joint has the lowest value, and in this case the
fracture location may be the interface between the cemented carbide and filler
alloy. Numerical simulation and experimental results both indicate that in order

Strain hardening and tensile behaviors of gradient structure Mg alloys with
different orientation relationships. Surface mechanical attrition treatment SMAT
was employed to produce gradient structures in AZ31BMg alloy samples with two
different initial textures. The structure of both samples can be regarded as an
integration of two main layers: the severely deformed layer exhibited dramatic
grain refinement to nano- and submicron-scale with weakened and randomized
textures; the less deformed layer exhibited the inherited coarse grains with
increased dislocation density, possessing the similar texture with the sample
prior to SMAT. All the samples containing different layer constituents cut from
the SMAT alloys showed remarkable increase of strength compared to the original
Mg alloy. However, the two integral SMAT samples with different initial textures
exhibited marked difference in uniform elongation UE during tension. That was
attributed to the different strain hardening behaviors influenced by the
deformation coordination and strain partitioning between layers with different
orientation relationships. The 0 oriented SMAT sample showed no macroscopic
strain transfer or slip transmission across layers, which was hard to cause
dislocation accumulation throughout the whole thickness of the layered sample.
That resulted in a limited strain hardening and UE. However, the favored
orientation relationship between layers of the 45 oriented SMAT sample
facilitated the strain transfer and slip continuity across the layers. That
generated a dynamically migrating interface during tension, which allowed the
dislocations accumulating over the whole sample volume. This caused a pronounced
strain hardening and sustained UE to an appreciable value.

Recrystallization Behavior of the Nickel-Based ODS Superalloy PM 1000. PM 1000
is a nickel-based oxide dispersion strengthened ODS superalloy used for high-
temperature applications. The primary recrystallization of a &lt;100&gt;-fiber
textured coarsegrained oxide dispersion strengthened nickel-based superalloy PM
1000 has been investigated. The annealing behavior of this alloy is quite
complex. Even when annealing is performed at high homologous temperatures e.g.
0.9 Tm, Tm is the melting point, recrystallization is partial. In order to
understand such a behavior, the microstructure of specimens in both the as-
received, deformed, and annealed conditions has been imaged in detail using
scanning electron microscopy SEM, transmission electron microscopy TEM, and
high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction EBSD. In the annealed state we
observe a significant volume fraction of tiny crystals in the interior of the
recovered grains. These tiny grains are elongated and grow mostly along the
existing low angle dislocation boundaries anisotropic growth. In the present
paper we propose a twinningassisted nucleation mechanism to clarify their origin

Superior mechanical properties and strengtheningtoughening mechanisms of

strengtheningtoughening mechanisms of gradient-structured low-alloying steel
were investigated, where the grain size and density of retained geometrical
necessary dislocationschange continuously. A plausible strengthductility synergy
was achieved by the gradient structures, featuring as an inverse linear rule
between the strength and ductility. This condition was attributed to the
continuous work hardening from the surface to the core and caused by the
sustaining accumulation of A simultaneous enhancement of yield strength and
impact toughness was obtained at a specific gradient structure compared with the
coarse grain counterpart. The characterization of the fracture morphology of the
sample with high strength and toughness showed the prominent ductile fracture by
microvoid coalescence, which was contrast to the predominant brittle cleavage
fracture of the sample with high strength but low toughness. This study is of
great importance to the development of advanced structural materials with

The Effects of Graphene on the Conductivity of Polypropylene Shielding
Materials. In this paper, polypropylene PP and ethylene-octene copolymer
elastomers POE were used as the matrix resin, and carbon black CB and graphene
GNP were added as conductive fillers. An X-ray diffractometer was used to
compare the crystal structure of CB and GNP, and the dispersion of conductive
fillers in the materials were observed by scanning electron microscopy. The
relationship between the electrical conductivity of the composite material and
the temperature was explored. The effect of graphene on the conductive
performance of the shielding material was evaluated. The results show that the
addition of GNP can improve the conductivity of the shielding material at a
lower content of conductive fillers; however, at a higher content of conductive
fillers, the improvement of the conductivity of the shielding material is
insignificant.

Formation of metastable Li2Al3Y through rapid solidification processing. A
microstructure composed of coherent metastable L1 2 second-phase particles in a
matrix of a supersaturated Al solid solution has been produced via rapid
solidification processing of AlY alloys. Splat-quenched samples of the nominal
compositions Al with 1, 3, 5, and 8 at.% Y and droplet samples made with the
droplet emulsion technique were characterized by differential scanning
calorimetry DSC, differential thermal analysis DTA, scanning electron
microscopy, X-ray diffraction XRD, and transmission electron microscopy. The 5
and 8 at.% Y splat samples exhibit a uniform fine dispersion of coherent
metastable L1 2 second-phase particles with a lattice parameter of 0.4234 nm,
while the 1 at.% Y splat sample exhibits a cellular structure. Thermal cycling
of splat-quenched A13at.%Y showed an exothermic signal on first heating at
around corresponding to the partial decomposition of the metastable structure,
with some retained L1 2 phase structure detectable by XRD following heating of
the sample to in the DSC. DTA of the droplets revealed undercoolings in excess

A coupled theory for soft materials at finite strain with heat conduction,
diffusion and chemical reactions. This paper focuses on developing a
thermodynamically consistent continuum theory for chemo-active soft materials,
by coupling large deformation, chemical reaction, species transport and heat
conduction. Although many efforts have been devoted to studying large
deformation coupled with diffusion in soft materials, a full thermo-chemo-
mechanically coupled theory for soft materials is still necessary especially
when diffusion and reaction are coexistent. In this paper, to consider the
coupling between diffusion and reaction, we introduce two kinds of independent
state variables into the Helmholtz free energy function,e., the diffusion
concentration of a diffusive species absorbed by the host solid and the extent
of a reaction. Moreover, we establish the evolution rule of the reaction extent
based on conventional reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, different from the
traditional linear phenomenological description. Finally, to illustrate this
proposed theory, a gel with moisture absorption and hydrolysis reaction is
studied by using a hyperelastic constitutive model and its chemo-mechanical
responses are predicted at the transient and steady states.

Topological mechanical metamaterials: A brief review. Topological mechanical
metamaterials have emerged with the development of topological phases and
topological phase transitions in modern condensed matter physics. Their
attractive topological properties provide promising applications that are hard
to achieve with traditional mechanical metamaterials, such as waveguiding
without backscattering loss, vibration isolation, and free motion of structures.
In this review, we briefly retrospectively examine the most flourishing works on
topological mechanical metamaterials and identify the mechanisms underlying
these topological mechanical phases, such as analogs to quantum Hall effects and
Weyl semimetals. Topological mechanical phases are classified into two
categories of t depending on their behavior when working in different frequency
domains, as finite frequency properties 0 are related to elastic wave
propagation and zero frequency properties =0 are related to quasi-static free
motion. We conclude by outlining future challenges and opportunities for the
topological mechanism, and the design/fabrication and application of topological
mechanical metamaterials.

Influence of texture and hydrostatic pressure on the room temperature
compression of NiAl polycrystals. Compression of NiAl polycrystals was carried
out at room temperature under atmospheric as well as 0.4 GPa confining pressure
at constant strain rate. The stressstrain curves show that the strength as well
as the work-hardening rate is generally higher when deformed under hydrostatic
pressure. Moreover, there is a strong plastic anisotropy, that is, samples
having a 100 crystallographic preferred orientation parallel to the compression
axis are much harder than those having 110 and 111. Similarly, the frequency of
microcracking shows the same tendency. It seems that the microcracks in the
samples deformed under confining pressure mainly result from internal stresses
released after unloading. The strength of the differently textured samples at
elevated strains correlates with the Taylor energy calculated. These
calculations also explain for certain textures the deviation from a homogeneous
shape change during compression towards planestrain deformation. The textural
changes produced by deformation are simulated with the Taylor model.

Diffusion in and around alginate and chitosan films with embedded sub-millimeter
voids. Hydrogel scaffolds from biopolymers have potential use in the controlled
release of drugs, and as 3-D structure for the formation of tissue matrix. This
article describes the solute release behavior of alginate and chitosan films
with embedded voids of sub-millimeter dimensions. Nitrogen gas was bubbled in a
fluidic arrangement to generate bubbles, prior to the crosslinking. The
crosslinked gel was dried in a vacuum oven, and subsequently, soaked in Vitamin
B-12 solution. The dimensions of the voids immediately after the cross-linking
of gel, and also after complete drying were obtained using a digital microscope
and scanning electron microscope respectively. The porosity of the gel was
measured gravimetrically. The release of Vitamin B-12 in PBS buffer on a shaker
was studied. The release experiments were repeated at an elevated temperature of
in the presence of lysozyme. The diffusion coefficient within the gel layer and
the mass transfer coefficient at the interface with the bulk-liquid were
estimated using a mathematical model. For comparison, the experiment was
repeated with a film that does not have any embedded void. The enhancement in
diffusion coefficient due to the presence of voids is discussed in this article.

PHASE CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND INTERMOLECULAR INTERACTION OFPOLYETHYLENE
GLYCOL/CHITOSAN COMPOSITE. Polyethylene glycol PEG/Chitosan composite phase
change material prepared from acetic acid were studied with thermal analysis and
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FT-IR. The results show that when the
chitosan fraction in the composite is higher than 15%, it exhibits solid-solid
phase change behavior. FT-IR investigation illustrates that there is strong
interaction between PEG and chitosan based upon intermolecular hydrogen bonds,
which restricts the freedom of the transitional motion of the PEG within the
composite at its melting point and makes it exhibit solidification phase
behavior.

Effect of microstructure on the high-temperature deformation behavior of NbSi
alloys. Deformation behavior of NbSiZr alloys is investigated at various
temperatures ranging from R.T. to. The master alloy ingots composed of Nb18.1at%
Si1.5at% Zr doped with Mg are Ar-arc-melted. The ingots contain Nb rods radius:
1m in Nb3Si matrix formed by eutectic reaction. Alloys are subjected to heat
treatments at for 4100h to obtain a large Nb network structure with small
silicide -Nb5Si3 particles by decomposing Nb3Si matrix into Nb and Nb5Si3
through a eutectoid reaction. Compression tests are conducted at room
temperature in air and at elevated temperatures in Ar atmosphere. At the maximum
strength is 500MPa and compressive ductility is higher than 10% with a strain
rate of 1.010 4 s 1 , while at room temperature the maximum strength is over
1500MPa and compressive ductility is about 1.5%. The high-temperature
deformation obeys a power-law type equation. The stress exponent n is evaluated
to be 4.8 and the apparent activation energy is 350kJ/mol. The Vickers
indentation at room temperature revealed that the crack propagation at room
temperature is suppressed effectively by ductile Nb. This suggests that the Nb
aggregate in the network structure acts as a large Nb grain containing fine
Nb5Si3 particles, which might be beneficial for ductility at low temperatures.

Coupled Thermodynamic Analysis of Heating Unit of Sensor. The heating
unit,composed of an alumina board and platinum resistance slicePRS coated
through magnetron sputtering approach,is an important part of catalytic
combustion sensor.As electric current flows,the heat generated by PRS makes the
temperature of board increase.The non-uniformly distributed temperature on the
board can lead to thermal stress and the deformation of PRS and board,which
affects the efficiency of sensor.In order to investigate the possible influence
of temperature distribution,finite element methodFEM was applied to the coupled
thermodynamic analysis on heating unit of the sensor in terms of temperature and
stress-strain fields.Results show that tensile stress exists on the surface of
sensor.Within the range of operating temperature,tensile stress is lower than
the strength limit of the material so that the senor can work normally.

Characterisation of the Phase Transformations in a Metastable Titanium Alloy.
beta titanium alloys are more and more best choice materials for automotive and
aerospace applications due to their high performance to density ratio. Among
these alloys, the TIMETAL Ti-LCB is already used in the automotive industry
since it presents excellent mechanical properties and a lower cost compared to
other Ti alloys. The present study deals with the characterisation of the
nucleation and growth of the alpha phase during several thermomechanical
processes since the distribution and size of the alpha grains strongly influence
the mechanical properties of the resulting microstructures. Several heat
treatments were conducted after annealing. The resulting microstructures were
characterised by SEM, TEM, XRD or EBSD. It is observed that the morphology and
the volume fraction of the alpha phase is strongly dependent on the holding
temperature, on the heating or cooling rate and on the beta grain size.

Titanium dental implant surfaces obtained by anodic spark deposition From the
past to the future. Commercial titanium-based dental implants are obtained
applying various methods such as machining, acid etching, anodization, plasma
spraying, grit blasting or combination techniques yielding materials with smooth
or micro-roughened surfaces. Those techniques are used to optimize the surface
properties and to maximize biocompatibility and bioactivity with bone tissue.
Present review is focused on the material surfaces obtained by anodic spark
deposition ASD. From the early 1980s till present, the results of numerous
studies have shown that anodically oxidized surfaces with different dopants
express a positive effect on osteoblasts behavior in vitro and osseointegration
in vivo. Those surfaces demonstrated a high biocompatibility and rapid
osseointegration in clinical application. This paper provides an overview of the
preparation of implant surfaces by employing ASD process. Moreover, reviewed are
clinically used ASD implant surfaces Ticer, TiUnite, Osstem, etc.. The
electrolyte variations in ASD process and their influence on surface properties
are given herein. Using different electrolytes, anode voltages and temperatures,
the above fabrication process can yield various surface morphologies from smooth
to rough, porous surfaces. Furthermore, ASD enables thickening of oxide layers
and enrichment with different dopands from used electrolyte, which hinder
release of potentially toxic titanium ions in surrounding tissue. Particularly
exciting results were achieved by calcium and phosphorus doping of the oxide
layer Ticer, ZL Microdent; TiUnite, Nobel Biocare Holding AB which significantly
increased the osteocompatibility. Ticer, a dental implant with anodically
oxidized surface and the first among similar materials employed in clinical
practice, was found to promote fast osteoblast cell differentiation and
mineralization processes. Moreover, Ticer accelerate the integration with the
bone, increase the bone/implant contact and improve primary and secondary
stability of the implants. Additionally, potential innovations in this field
such as fabrication of nanotubes on the implant surfaces as well as novel
approaches e.g. coating with proteins, nanostructured topography; combining
implant body and surface derived from titanium and zirconia are elaborated in
this review. Besides, biochemical aspects on implant surface cell/tissue
interaction are summarized. From the clinical point of view implant surfaces
fabricated by ASD technology possess fast and improved osseointegration, high
healing rates and long term prognosis.

Apparent critical layer thickness in ZnSe/GaAs001 heterostructures and the role
of finite experimental resolution. The critical layer thickness hc for the onset
of lattice relaxation has important implications for the design of pseudomorphic

theoretical models have been developed for the critical layer thickness,
including the well-known force-balance model of Matthews and Blakeslee J. Cryst.
Growth 27, 188 1974. Experimentally measured critical layer thicknesses in
ZnSe/GaAs001 heterostructures are often at variance with one another as well as
the Matthews and Blakeslee model. By assuming that the lattice relaxation is a
fixed fraction of the equilibrium relaxation constant /eq, Fritz Appl. Phys.
Lett. 51, 1080 1987 has shown that the measured hc may be much larger than the
equilibrium value when using a finite experimental resolution. However, the
assumption of constant fractional relaxation is not applicable to any
heterostructure exhibiting kinetically limited lattice relaxation. In order to
reconcile the conflicting r...

The High Performance Shape Memory Effect HPSME in Ni Rich NiTiWires: InSitu
X-Ray Diffraction on Thermal Cycling. A novel approach for using Shape Memory
Alloys SMA was recently proposed and named highperformance shape memory effect
HPSME. The HPSME exploits the thermal cycling of stress-induced martensite for
producing extremely high mechanical work with a very stable functional fatigue
behaviour in Ni rich NiTi alloy. The latter was found to differ significantly
from the functional fatigue behaviour observed for conventional SMA. This study
was undertaken in order to elucidate the microstructural modifications at the
basis of this particular feature. To this purpose, the functional fatigue was
coupled to in situ Synchrotron Radiation X-Ray Diffraction, by recording
patterns on wires thermally cycled by Joule effect under a constant applied
stress 800 MPa. The accurate analysis the line profile XRD data suggests the
accumulation of defects upon functional cycling, while the fibre texture was not
observed to change. The functional fatigue exhibits a very similar behaviour as
the line broadening of XRD peaks, thus suggesting the accumulation of
dislocations as the origin of the mechanism of the permanent deformation.

properties including microhardness and sliding wear were evaluated. The results
indicated that the laser surface treatment was beneficial to increase the

Laboratory Study on Properties of Diatomite and Basalt Fiber Compound Modified
Asphalt Mastic. In order to improve the performance of asphalt mastic, some
researchers have added diatomite or basalt fiber as a modifier to the asphalt
mastic, and the results show that some properties of the asphalt mastic were
improved. For the simultaneous addition of diatomite and basalt fiber, two kinds
of modifier, compound modified asphalt mastic had not been reported; in this
paper, thirteen groups of diatomite and basalt fiber DBFCMAM compound modified
asphalt mastic with different content were prepared to study the performance.
Softening point, cone penetration, viscosity, and DSR tests were conducted, for
the high temperature performance evaluation of DBFCMAM, whereas force ductility
and BBR tests were used in the low temperature performance study of the DBFCMAM.
The results demonstrated that the high temperature performance of DBFCMAM was
increased; moreover, the low temperature performance of DBFCMAM improved by
diatomite and basalt fiber according to the results of the force ductility test;
however, the conclusion of the BBR test data was inconsistent with the force
ductility test. In summary, the high temperature and low temperature properties

Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 thin films
grown on LaAlO3100. Thin films of Laa 0.33 MnO3 have been deposited at room
temperature on LaAlO3100 substrates by dc magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited
films are amorphous and become polycrystalline on annealing ex situ at in oxygen
ambient. Topographic and tunneling spectroscopic features of annealed films have
been studied by a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature in air. The
main microstructural features in these films are the presence of fish-scale or
slate like plates, terraces of integer multiple of unit cell or half-unit cell
parameter height and oblate shaped grains. Grain boundaries have been identified
from the orientation of terraced grains with respect to the substrate plane.
Such a planar growth accompanied by grain boundaries may enhance
magnetoresistance both at and below ferromagnetic transition temperature. An
average barrier height of 4.0 eV of Laa 0.33 MnO3 has been obtained from
currentvoltage measurements. A band gap of 0.2 eV has been found from the
existence of states near the Fermi level in the density of states spectrum.

Effect of nickel substitution on structural, optical, magnetic properties and
photocatalytic activity of ZnS nanoparticles. In the present work, we propose a
cost effective, less complicated and an effective way of synthesizing Zn1xNixS
nanoparticle using wet chemical precipitation method. And the material is used
for removal of dye decolorization process, which overcomes the constraints
caused in the conventional techniques namely chlorination, adsorption,
ozonization. The structural analysis shows primary phase cubic zinc blende
Zn1xNixS and rhombohedral -NiS secondary phase with the average grain size of
20nm. The electron microscopic analysis clearly depicts the nanophase formation.
The strong blue shift in the UVvisible absorption region 410nm confirms the nano
dimensional state of Zn1xNixS nano particles. FT-IR analysis shows the presence
of functional groups adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles. Magnetic
measurement by VSM shows that the prepared nanoparticles possess super
paramagnetic and room temperature weak ferromagnetic properties. Visible light

An ultra-sensitive and wide measuring range pressure sensor with paper-based CNT
film/interdigitated structure. Flexible pressure sensors have attracted great
attention due to their potential in the wearable devices market and in
particular in human-machine interactive interfaces. Pressure sensors with high
sensitivity, wide measurement range, and low-cost are now highly desired for
such practical applications. In the present investigation, an ultrasensitive
pressure sensor with wide measurement range has been successfully fabricated.
Carbon nanotubesuniformly sprayed on the surface of paper comprise the
sensitivity material, while lithographed interdigital electrodes comprise the
substrate. Due to the synergistic effects ofhigh specific surface area, papers
porous structure, interdigital electrodes efficient contact with CNT, our
pressure sensor realizes a wide measurement range from 0 to 140kPa and exhibits
excellent stability through 15,000 cycles of testing. For the paper-based CNT
film/interdigitated structure PCI pressure sensor, the connection area between
the sensitive material and interdigital electrodes dominates in the low-pressure
region, while internal change within the sensitive materials plays the leading
role in the high-pressure region. Additionally, the PCI pressure sensor not only
displays a high sensitivity of 2.72kPa1 up to 35kPa but also can detect low
pressures, such as that exerted by a resting mung bean about 8Pa. When attached
to the surface of a human body, the pressure sensor can monitor physiological
signals, such as wrist movement, pulse beats, or movement of throat muscles.
Furthermore, the pressure sensor array can identify the spatial pressure
distribution, with promising applications in human-machine interactive
interfaces.

Compaction of powders III: Molybdenum disulfide. In this paper the compaction
behavior of molybdenum disulfide powder at ambient temperature is described.
Compaction occurs via a fragmentation process rather than a plastic deformation
process. The progress of the compaction phenomenon has been followed by a series
of photomicrographs showing relative movement of particles as a function of
external pressure. Contrary to popular belief there is no indication of lateral
movement of particles nor is there any evidence that particles slide past one
another. Displacement in the direction of applied force occurs by individual
particles fragmenting with the finer fragments filling the interstitial void
between particles. Scanning electron micrographs of the powder grains reveal
that the grains are composed of aggregates of smaller particles with plate-like
characteristics, accounting for the relatively high porosity of the grains. The
relationship of apparent density and porosity with applied pressure is analogous
to those for zirconia and thoria powders.

A Simple Ion Flux Estimation in a Low Pressure R.F. Plasma 13.56 MHz. A new
application of the sputtering rate measurement is given in this paper. In fact,
by measuring the sputtering rate of different materials fixed on the radio
frequency r.f. biased electrode, it is possible to determine easily ion flux
that falls onto this biased electrode. This study is realized in a low pressure
0.4 Pa argon planar r.f. discharge system 13.56 MHz. This sputtering method is
interesting to have informations about the deposition process in physical vapour
deposition. In order to demonstrate the validity of this method, experiments
have been carried out in two reactors, each one with different geometrical
parameters and the results obtained have been compared and confirmed using the
Child-Langmuir law. The ion flux increases as a function of the incident r.f.
power 0-300 W. The values obtained range from 10 18 to 10 19 ions m -2 s -1 .
These results in an argon plasma are applied to estimate incident ion flux in a
nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, we show that it is possible to evaluate the
incident ion flux by measuring the sputtering rate when the plasma is densified
using either an auxiliary hot cathode discharge or an additional magnetic field.
These experimental cases correspond respectively to r.f. triode ion plating or
r.f. magnetron sputtering.

An Investigation into Work Hardening of Shot Peening Affected Layer Using X-Ray
Stress Analysis Technique. The work hardening effect of the shot peening
affected layer of hardened and low temperature tempered spring steel was
investigated using the method for determining the yield strength of a metallic
surface with biaxial residual stress. The results show that for the surface
layer of the specimens, the microhardness and half-width values of X-ray
diffraction lines is decreased, whereas the yield strength is increased during
shot peening. Thus, shot peening leads the surface layer of steel in hard state
to work hardening instead of work softening.

A calorimetric and metallographic study of precipitation process in AA6061 and
its composites. A calorimetric study carried out on AA6061 alloy and SiC
particulate and -Al2O3Saffil fibre reinforced composites has shown that the
positions of the exothermic reaction peaks in DSC spectra were influenced by the
vacancy concentration V.C. retained after quenching, in addition to the
influence of the presence of ceramic reinforcement in the materials. It was also
found that the influence of V.C. was more effective in the unreinforced base
alloy than in the SiC p composite. Furthermore, a relatively larger exothermic
reaction peak associated with precipitation of the MgSi needle-shaped phase and
a smaller peak for the MgSi rod-shaped precipitates were observed in the DSC
thermograms of the composites. These observations indicated that during the
temperature scanning, a higher density of dislocations in the matrix would
enhance the precipitation of the needle phase, which in turn would deplete the
matrix, and suppress the formation of the rod precipitates. The results obtained
from the strained AA6061 base alloy, plastically deformed after quenching,
strongly support the above conclusion. It is believed that the accelerated
ageing response observed in AA6061 composites was caused mainly by an enhanced
precipitation of the needle-shaped precipitates in the matrix.

The Influence of Fluid Flow on Intermetallic Phases in AlCast Alloys. Technical
AlSi alloys always contain sufficient amounts of Fe and Mn, especially alloys
made from scrap. During casting, Fe-containing intermetallics, such as AlFe,
AlFeSi and AlFe- MnSi phases, are formed between the aluminum dendrites. Fe and
Mn-rich intermetallic phases are well known to be strongly influential on
mechanical properties in AlSi alloys. In the present work the influence of
controlled fluid flow conditions on the morphology and spatial arrangement on
intermetallic phases in cast AlSi alloys is characterized. A binary Al-7wt.%Si
and a ternary Al- 7wt.%Si-1wt.%Fe alloy was solidified under and without the
influence of a rotating magnetic field 3mT at 50Hz over a range of
solidification velocities 0.015- 0.18mm/s at a constant temperature gradient G
of/mm. The scientific results reached so far indicate a strong influence of the
electromagnetic stirring on the primary dendrite and secondary dendrite arm
spacings.

Effect of Mo on Properties and Microstructure of Steel-Bonded Cemented Carbide
GT35 Produced by InSitu Reduction of Ilmenite. Steel-bonded cemented carbide
GT35 was fabricated from natural ilmenite by in-situ carbothermic reduction and
vacuum pressureless sintering. The effects of Mo-doped on the mechanical
properties and microstructures of GT35 composites were investigated. That the
good mechanical properties of steel-bonded cemented carbide GT35 with 9wt% Mo
were obtained at the same sintering condition that the density reached
6.223g/cm3 and the average bending strength reached about 1155.6MPa after heat
treatment, but the hardness dropped the lowest value HRC 60.94 and the
difference was not apparent with the change of Mo content. The additive of Mo is
beneficial to be refinement of carbide particle size, sphericity of grains and
formation of compact composite. In-situ reduction of natural ilmenite was a
feasible way to fabricate good performance composite GT35 with a relative low
cost.

Growth and characterization of phosphorus doped Si1yCy alloy grown by photo- and
plasma-CVD at very low temperature. The properties of Si1 y C y alloys grown on
Si001 by photo- and plasma-CVD are described. Epitaxial Si films were obtained
by the addition of C2H2 , CH4 or SiH2CH32 to SiH4 and H2 gases at a substrate
temperature of by these two methods. Hydrogen incorporated in the epitaxial
films during growth was observed to desorb on thermal annealing. The local
vibration mode 607 cm 1 of C in Si was observed in the Raman spectra of films
annealed at. X-ray reciprocal lattice space mapping showed the Si1 y C y alloys
to be pseudomorphic. The highest substitutional C content of 3.5 at.% was
obtained in the films grown with the addition of SiH2CH32 . In-situ phosphorus
doping was also carried out using PH3 . The electron concentration of Si1 y C y
films was lower than that of Si films grown at the same PH3 /SiH4 ratio.
However, the electron concentration was found to increase to the same level as
Si films after annealing at, to a magnitude of 510 18 cm 3 . This result implies
that dopant neutralization occurred in the as-grown Si1 y C y films.

Characteristics of grain refinement in oxygen-free copper processed by equal-
channel angular pressing and dynamic testing. Oxygen-free copper was processed
by equal-channel angular pressing ECAP at room temperature for 1, 4 and 8 passes
and then the ECAP specimens were further deformed by dynamic testing at using a
strain rate of 10 s1. Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of
the initial microstructures induced by ECAP on the subsequent grain refinement
and mechanical properties after dynamic testing. The results show the strength
of copper increased with increasing numbers of ECAP passes and a significant
additional grain refinement was produced in the ECAP specimens through the
dynamic testing. Thus, the initial grain sizes after ECAP for 1, 4 and 8 passes
were ~16, ~4.4 and ~2.9m, respectively, and these values were reduced to ~400,
~330 and ~300nm by dynamic testing, The grains were refined by conventional
dislocation processes in the 1-pass specimen but there was evidence for dynamic
recrystallization in the specimen processed by 8 passes.

Characterizing Fatigue Failure Behavior of Modified Asphalt Binders from Linear
Amplitude Sweep Test. The fatigue characteristics of asphalt binder contributes
to the fatigue resistance of asphalt concrete and pavements. The linear
amplitude sweep LAS test AASHTO TP 101 has been developed as the accelerated
testing procedure for fatigue specification of asphalt binders in the United
States. Recently a newly energy-based fatigue failure definition and unified
failure criterion have been proposed for improving the LAS procedure and data
interpreting. However, these new improvements need more verification and
calibration on more materials with different modifiers for distinguishing the
fatigue performance. In this paper, the improved LAS testing procedure was
applied on totally two neat asphalt binders and six modified asphalt binders,
which covered the high modulus asphalt binders SBS modified binder, high
viscosity HV binder and crumb rubber CR modified binder. Based on the
simplified-viscoelastic continuum damage SVECD modeling approach, three material
properties of linear viscoelastic property, damage characteristic curve and
failure criterion were characterized for fatigue life prediction of all tested
binders. Test results indicates that the CR binder demonstrated the highest
failure strain followed by the SBS and compound SBS+HV binders,and neat binders.
Further results of predictive fatigue life also verified the best fatigue life
of CR binder followed by SBS+HV binders, SBS binder and The HV additives to SBS
binder was found to linearly increase the binder fatigue lives and the HMAB-RA
showed better fatigue performance than HMAB-PR. Generally, the fatigue life
ranking determined from the multiple-loading rates of LAS tests is consistent to
the failure strain results and thus, the failure strain identified from the
standard LAS-5 test could be used as a fatigue performance parameter.

Characterization of submicrometer phase particles in rapidly solidified Mg20Nd.
The rapid solidification processing technique of chill block melt spinning has
led to a significant improvement in the corrosion resistance of Mg20Nd. A
pseudopassivation effect is observed in melt-spun Mg20Nd ribbons due to the
presence of many tessellated regions containing submicrometer-sized rod-like and
ultrafine phase particles. These particles were isolated by matrix dissolution
and extraction replication techniques for further study. X-ray and electron
diffraction techniques revealed that the phase crystal structure was simple
cubic with a = 9.1 A . Hot stage transmission electron microscopy and
differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the phase was metastable up to
approximately 644F. Energy dispersive spectroscopy results on precision ion
milled extraction replicas indicated that the stoichiometry of the phase was
Mg32Nd.

Electrical characteristics of n-type diamond Schottky diodes and metal/diamond

metal/diamond interfaces have been systematically investigated for phosphorus
P-doped homoepitaxial diamond layers. The current-voltage IV characteristics of
the Ni/n-type diamond Schottky diode show excellent rectification properties
from to. The ideality factor and the rectification ratio were 1.0 and 10 6 at
+10 V at, respectively. The rectifying properties deteriorated with increasing P
concentration in the diamond layers. Temperature-dependent capacitance-frequency
C-f and conductance-frequency G-f measurements on the Schottky diodes have shown
that the capacitance is reduced at high frequency due to the inability of deep
centers to maintain an equilibrium ionization state under a high-frequency
modulation. C- V measurements deduced that the P electrical activity the ratio
of the net donor concentration to the P concentration was nearly 1 from low
concentration 1.6 x 10 16 cm -3 to high concentration 2.7 x 10 18 cm -3 of P.
The Schottky barrier height was found to be almost constant at 4.3 eV

Effects of DC Negative Bias Voltage on the Structure and Properties of Diamond-

substrate by DC-RF-PECVD method.The effects of DC negative bias voltage on
surface morphology,microstructure,growth rate and hardness of DLC films were
investigated by atomic force microscopy,Raman spectroscopy,X-ray photoelectron
spectrometry,infrared spectroscopy,surface profilometer and nano-indentation.As
a result,the films deposited without DC negative bias voltage have an organic
polymer-like structure with low SP+3 content and hardness.When deposited with DC
negative bias voltage,the films have typical diamond-like characteristics with
high SP+3 content and hardness.However,the growth rate and H content decrease
with the increase of DC negative bias voltage,and the SP+3 content and hardness
of the films increase to a maximum value at a DC negative bias voltage of 200V
and then decrease thereafter.

Experiment and Numerical Studies on Heat Loss in a Hydro-Distillation with
Various Insulations. InAsia, Agarwood oil is obtained by conventional extraction
methods which consume significant energy, amount of solvents, and process time.
One of the conventional extraction methods is traditional hydrodistillation
using stainless steel distiller covered by concrete. This study evaluates the
heat loss during agarwood during agarwood hydro-distillation process with the
aim at optimizing it using insulation techniques. Six insulation materials
namely, Polyurethane, Aluminum Silicate, Glass Wool, Mineral Wool and Nitrile
Rubber have been investigated experimentally and numerically using software
Engineering Equation Solver EES to determine their effectiveness in reducing the
heat loss from the boiler. Interestingly, higher heat loss recorded by the
boiler surrounded by the concrete than when the boiler was heated barely. The
best insulations with more than 18% efficiency of bare distiller demonstrated by
glass wool and polyurethane whilst the worst efficiency was Aluminum Silicate.
This finding is significant to help designers to choose the insulation material
for improving engineering economics of hydro-distillation process.

Dynamic compressive loading of expanded perlite/aluminum syntactic foam. This
paper addresses the analysis of expanded perlite/aluminum EP/A356 syntactic
foams under dynamic compressive loading conditions. Experimental and numerical
analysis are conducted in order to determine compressive stressstrain response,
effective material properties and deformation mechanisms. Foam samples are
manufactured by combining A356 aluminum alloy with expanded perlite particles
that introduce 6065% porosity. Under compressive loading these pores gradually
collapse resulting in an approximately constant macroscopic stress level of the
syntactic foam. Testing at different compression velocities shows that the
expanded perlite particles increase the compression resistance at higher strain
rates. The effective material properties of the syntactic foam increase both
with density and loading velocity. Infrared IR thermal imaging and finite
element analysis allowed the independent identification of the dominant
deformation mechanism: single struts that are parallel to the loading direction
buckle and trigger the formation of multiple collapse bands that are
approximately perpendicular to the loading direction.

Microstructure, texture and mechanical properties evolution of extruded fine-
grained MgY sheets during annealing. The microstructure, texture and mechanical
properties evolution of the extruded fine-grained Mg-1, 5 Y wt% alloy sheets
were investigated during annealing. The as-extruded sheets exhibited a fully
dynamic recrystallized DRXed microstructure consisting of uniform and fine
equiaxed grains 5.78.7m and a small amount of YH2 second phase particles. Both
sheets exhibited significant thermal stability at annealing and remarkable grain
growth at temperatures higher than. The measured grain growth activation energy
Q of Mg-1Y at all temperatures tested was 91 3kJ/mol, suggesting that the growth
was controlled by grain boundary diffusion. Meanwhile, for Mg-5Y alloy at lower
temperatures 300400C, the Q value 59kJ/mol indicated that the grain growth was
controlled by grain boundary diffusion while the Q value 175kJ/mol at higher
temperatures 400450C implied that lattice self-diffusion controlled the process.
A representative rare-earth texture was present for both sheets in the as-
extruded condition, and remarkable basal texture weakening was observed with the
grain growth during each isothermal annealing process. The texture weakening can
be ascribed to the preferential growth of non-basal oriented grains based on the
EBSD analysis, which was likely related to the segregation of Y atoms at grain
boundaries. The microhardness and grain size relationship can be described well
by the Hall-Petch relation for all the annealed sheets, while the yield stress
was not the case indicating that the macroscopic strength was more sensitive to
the texture than the localized microhardness.

Evaluation of Ultrasonic Nonlinear Characteristics in Heat-Treated Aluminum
Alloy AlMgSiCu. The nonlinear ultrasonic technique has been known to be more
sensitive to minute variation of elastic properties in material than the
conventional linear ultrasonic method. In this study, the ultrasonic nonlinear
characteristics in the heat-treated aluminum alloy AlMgSiCu have been evaluated.
For this, the specimens were heat treated for various heating period up to 50
hours at three different heating temperatures:,, and. The ultrasonic nonlinear
characteristics of each specimen were evaluated by measuring the ultrasonic
nonlinear parameter from the amplitudes of fundamental and second harmonic
frequency components in the transmitted ultrasonic wave. After the ultrasonic
test, tensile strengths and elongations were obtained by the tensile test to
compare with the parameter . The heating time showing a peak in the parameter
was identical to that showing critical change in the tensile strength and
elongation, and such peak appeared at the earlier heating time in the higher
heating temperature. These results suggest that the ultrasonic nonlinear
parameter can be used for monitoring the variations in elastic properties of
aluminum alloys according to the heat treatment.

Strain-induced ferromagnetism in FeAl single crystals. Cold work can induce a
paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition in FeAl. The ferromagnetic behavior can
be explained in terms of wrong bonding in deformation-induced antiphase boundary
tubes. The implications of this mechanism are discussed. The magnetic behavior
of single crystal plates of Fe40Al and Fe50Al were measured in different
orientations both before and after deformation, and after quenching. Fe40Al
single crystal shows a much larger saturation magnetization at room temperature

Evaluation of the effects of the crystallinity of kinetically sprayed NiTiZrSiSn
bulk metallic glass on the scratch response. A bulk amorphous NiTiZrSiSn powder
produced using an inert gas atomization was sprayed by a kinetic spraying
process that is basically a solid-state deposition process onto a mild steel
substrate and they were successfully overlaid onto the mild steel substrate. In
order to evaluate the tribological behavior of the sprayed NiTiZrSiSn bulk
metallic glass coatings, a partially crystallized coating and a fully
crystallized coating were prepared by isothermal heat treatments. Tribological
properties were investigatedfriction coefficient, hardness and amorphous phase
fraction of coating layer. Surface morphologies and depth in the wear tracks
were observed and measured by scanning electron microscopy and -step. From the
examination of the scratch wear track microstructure, transition from ductile-
like deformation micro-cutting to brittle-deformation micro-fracturing in the
scratch groove was observed with the increase of the crystallinity.

Temperature dependence of luminescence in ZnSe. As-grown ZnSe and RbCl- and
CsCl-doped ZnSe single crystals are grown by a sublimination method. The

doped ZnSe from to. In as-grown and Zn-annealed ZnSe, the emission band
undergoes considerable attenuation at. However, the emission band is clearly
observed in Se-annealed ZnSe up to near room temperature. These results prove
that the disappearance of Se vacancies enhances room temperature PL.

Quantitative analysis of comprehensive evaluation indices for engineering
materials based on distinction degree. In order to build a scientific evaluation
index system to reduce the complexity of evaluation course,and distribute the
weight of each index reasonably,on the basis of normalizing the evaluation
indices of engineering materials,the conceptions of contribution and distinction
degree of evaluation index are put forward in this paper,and the criterion of
index quantitative selection is determined,i.e.the index should be deleted when
its distinction degree is less than 0.002.Eight kinds of evaluation indices of
six kinds of low temperature storage container materialsstainless steel were
quantitative analyzed according to the criterion mentioned above,and six kinds
of stainless steel were comprehensively evaluated with weighted average analysis
according to the index system before and after quantitative analysis.The
solution shows that,the evaluation results obtained from the indices after
quantitative analysis are consistent with those obtained from initial
indices,which can more effectively reflect whether the candidate material is
applicable to the working condition or not,validating the feasibility of
quantitative analysis evaluation indices of engineering materials based on
distinction degree.

Research of structure and properties of boride hardening coatings. High strength
aluminum alloys are particularly suitable as lightweight materials in vehicle
and aircraft engineering. The wear resistance of materials can be improved by
surface and coating technology. Strengthening of parts and units of machines,
increased reliability and longer service life is an important task of modern
industry. The aim of research was to apply boride coatings on surface of steel
parts. Timeliness is subject to necessity to harden surface of steel used in
high-load conditions. Samples of coatings on 65 G grade steel, applied by HFC-
heating, were obtained. Research of samples with different coatings by means of
metallurgical microscope was carried out. Data on samples with different
coatings research by means of an eddy current measuring system was obtained and
conclusion on electrical conductivity distribution along the sample surface
depending on flux quantitative content during boriding was made.

Modeling texture and microstructural evolution in the equal channel angular
extrusion process. In this work, we develop a modeling framework for predicting
the visco-plastic deformation, microstructural evolution distributions of grain
shape and size and texture evolution in polycrystalline materials during the
equal channel angular extrusion ECAE process, a discontinuous process of severe
shear straining. The foundation of this framework is a visco-plastic self-
consistent VPSC scheme. We consider a 90 die angle and simulate ECAE up to four
passes for four processing routes, A, C, B A and BC , as denoted in the
literature for an FCC polycrystalline material. We assume that the FCC single
crystal has a constant critical resolved shear stress CRSS, so that hardening by
dislocation activity is suppressed, and the influence of grain shape
distribution and texture as well as their interaction can be isolated. Many
deformation microstructural features, such as grain size and shape distribution,
texture, and geometric hardeningsoftening, were highly dependent on processing
route. Using a grain subdivision criterion based on grain shape, route A was the
most effective, then route B A and route BC and lastly route C, the least
effective for grain size refinement, in agreement with redundant strain theory.
For producing refined equiaxed grains, route BC was more effective than routes B
A and A. We show that graingrain interactions tend to weaken texture evolution
and consequently geometric hardening and softening in all routes.

Mechanochemically synthesized Ag2SSb2S3 amorphous fast ionic conductors. The
mechanochemical synthesis of Ag2S x Sb2S31 x amorphous fast ion conductors
a-FICs and their structural, thermal and electrical characterizations are
investigated. It is found that after 10h of ball-milling, the composition
0.85Ag2SSb2S3 becomes amorphous and attains a conductivity of 610 3 1 cm 1 at
which is three times greater than that of the analogous melt-quenched glass.
These a-FICs are found to be predominantly ionic in nature and stable under
battery conditions. By examining conductivity versus composition x , it is
concluded that the sharp rise in the conductivity with the dopant Ag2S content
is largely due to a significant increase in the mobility of Ag + ions. These
results imply that the role of salts such as Ag2S is not so much to provide free
Ag + ions for conduction but to modify the glass structure in a manner that
favours fast ion transport. It is believed that these findings will guide the
development of various models to relate ion transport with glass structure.

Comparison of the Mechanical Properties of Hastelloy X Material after Welding by
GTAW and NdYAG Laser. Cracks induced by metal fatigue and structural aging
effect cant be fixed by traditional Gas Tungsten Arc Welding GTAW, consequently
cause the increasing of defect ratio. Although some cracks might be acceptable
and qualified to field service standard subject to the military regulation,
however, in certain areas, e.g. brazing and coating areas, the results are not
ideal especially the HAZ and residual stress. In this study, NdYAG Laser welding
and traditional GTAW processes were performed on Hastelloy X superalloy for
comparison. Post-welding residual stress distribution was measured by X-ray
diffraction method. Macro- and microstructure were observed by metallurgical OM
and SEM in comparison to the hardness testing. Tensile test results show that
traditional welding technology has better ultimate tensile strength and
ductility. For the Nd:YAG laser welding, residual stress is limited to 3mm of
the both sides of weld and drops drastically, while higher amplitude and widely
spread in the GTAW welding. It is proposed that combining both methods, the
repairing process can be optimized to reduce the defect ratio and save repairing
time.

Preparation Methods and Ceramic Materials Selection Guideline for Thermal
Barrier Coatings. Thermal barrier coatingsare usually applied in aviation and
power generation industries, particularly in the gas-turbine engines for power
generation. The most common methods forproduction include electron beamphysical
vapor deposition EB-PVD and plasma spraying PS. The PSusually show the laminar
structure with abundant pores and cracks, whereas the EB-PVDpossess excellent
anti-corrosion and anti-oxidation capacities with higher thermal conductivity
than PSIn this review, recent progress on microstructure optimization and
failure problems based on the EB-PVD and PS methods was summarized. Several

Organic-inorganic hybrid materials: perfluorinated ionomers as sol-gel
polymerization templates for inorganic alkoxides. Mauritz et al. exploited the
polar/nonpolar nanophase-separated morphologies of Nafion perfluorinated ionomer
membranes, as well as a Nafion ionomeric precursor film, as interactive
templates that are capable of directing the condensation polymerizations of
inorganic alkoxides and organoalkoxysilanes as well as the ultimate geometrical
distribution of the inorganic oxide, or organically modified silicon oxide
phases that result upon drying. This paper is a review of our extensive studies
involving the in situ sol-gel reactions of the alkoxides of silicon, titanium,
aluminum, zirconium and organoalkoxysilanes, as well as their mixtures and two
step reactions involving these monomers. Throughout this presentation, we
demonstrate how various spectroscopic FTIR, 29 Si solid state NMR, dielectric
relaxation, pyrene Py fluorescence probe emission + UV absorption microscopic,
X-ray scattering, thermal DSC, TGA, TGA-FTIR, DMA, mechanical tensile, and gas
permeation tools were employed to interrogate the structures and properties of
these heterogeneous materials over a range of dimensional scales ranging from
the molecular to the macroscopic. Importantly, we established that these
organic/inorganic materials are indeed structured on the scale of nanometers.
Methods of tailoring the energetic environment, or polarity, within the cluster
domains by the insertion of inorganic oxide or organically modified silicate
nanostructures are presented. Finally, we discuss the potential for these
nanocomposite membranes within a number of areas including gas and liquid
separations technology as well as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell
technology.

Preparation, characterization and drug delivery study of a novel
nanobiopolymeric multidrug delivery system. New nanocarrier for codelivery of
curcumin and doxorubicin as the anticancer drugs was synthesized using
biocompatible and biodegradable materials. Firstly, an inclusion complex of
amylose Am and curcumin CUR was formed through entrapment of curcumin into the
amylose helices. Then the surface of amylose-curcumin AmCUR complex was modified
by polycaprolactone PCL via esterification reaction between hydroxyl functional
groups of amylose and carbonyl groups of PCL. Finally, poly citric acid PCA
reacted with terminal hydroxyl groups of PCL by esterification reaction. Then,
doxorubicin DOX reacted with the surface carboxylic acid functional groups of
AmCUR-PCL-PCA through noncovalent interactions to form AmCUR-PCL-PCA-DOX as a
multidrug delivery system. These new synthesized nanomaterials were
characterized by spectroscopic measurement methods such as IR spectroscopy, UV-
vis spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. FE-SEM
analyses and DLS measurements showed that the hydrodynamic dimensions of AmCur-
PCL-PCA were about 50nm. Due to the presence of ester bonds, the synthesized
nanomaterials are pH sensitive. Furthermore, the resulting copolymer was
completely water soluble because of the hydrophilic nature of poly citric acid
part of copolymer and therefore successfully can be utilized in biomedical
applications.

Structural, dielectric, and ferroelectric properties of PbTiO3 thin films by a
simple solgel technique. PbTiO3PT thin films were prepared on various substrates
by a simple solgel technique. The surface morphology and crystal structure,
dielectric, and ferroelectric properties of the thin films were investigated.
The orientation of PT thin films on Pt/Ti/Si substrates can gradually change
with the annealing temperature from a-axis preferential orientation to c-axis
preferential orientation. The PT films on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates have a bi-
axis preferential orientation, whereas the films on LaNiO3/SiO2/Si substrates
are randomly oriented due to the random orientation of LaNiO3 LNO electrode. The
dielectric constant, dissipation factor, remanent polarization, coercive field
are found to be 143, 0.032,cm2, and 115.3 kVcm1, respectively, for the thin
films on Pt/Ti/Si, and 115, 0.022,cm2, and 132.1 kVcm1, respectively, for the

Effect of Nb microalloying on microstructure evolution and mechanical properties
in low carbon medium manganese steel. The effect of Nb microalloying on
microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of7Mn steel was investigated.
The results showed that the microstructure was fully quenched martensite after
subjected to reheating and quenching RQ process. The microstructure consisted of
tempered -martensite, reversed austenite RA, and athermal -martensite after
tempered at, while the microstructure contained tempered -martensite, RA,
athermal -martensite, and athermal -martensite after tempered at. The thermal
and mechanical stability of both RA and athermal -martensite decreased after the
0.05% Nb was added to the7Mn steel, and also decreased as the intercritical
tempering IT temperature increased, which was mainly because the content of
solid solution C in RA decreased. The calculated stacking fault energieswere all
negative, which spontaneously induced athermal martensitic transformation.
Multiphase microstructure resulted in the remarkable mechanical property
evolution. After tempered at, the optical mechanical properties of 7Mn-0.05Nb
steel were obtained: yield strength of 720.0 MPa, tensile strength of 819.0 MPa,
total elongation of 26.0% and impact energy of 266 J, while the yield strength
of 675.0 MPa, tensile strength of 776.5 MPa, the total elongation of 29.5% and
the impact energy of 274 J appeared in 7Mn0Nb steel.the IT temperature increased
to, the yield strength of both the steels sharply decreased 475.5 MPa for0Nb
steel and 460.5 MPa for-0.05Nb steel, and the tensile strength of both the
steels increased about 56 MPa, while the impact energy decreased by 40 and 60 J,
respectively, showing that the impact energy was not very sensitive to the
mechanical stability of RA and athermal -martensite. The mean size of NbC
particles was mainly about 57 nm, which significantly improved the precipitation
strengthening, but there was just little damage to low-temperature toughness.

Case Studies on Localized Deformation Processes in High-Alloy
Fe16Cr6MnxNi0.05CCast Steels. This chapter is together with Chap. 6 the
principal part of this book. This chapter provides detailed results on the
application of the in situ characterization techniques introduced in Chap. 5 in
terms of three case studies: i the microscopic strain localizations during
plastic deformation, ii the temporal evolution of deformation processes and iii
the macroscopic strain localization during plastic deformation. The part on
microscopic strain localizations provides high-resolution sub-m results of
strain field calculations obtained during both tensile deformation at different
temperatures RT, 100 and and cyclic deformation at room temperature.
Furthermore, the magnitude of shear for individual microstructural constituents
austenite, e-martensite and -martensite was experimentally determined and shows
a good agreement with theoretical calculated values. The part on temporal
evolution of deformation processes shows that the acoustic emission is a
powerful tool to study the kinetics of deformation processes since it allows to
separate acoustic signals belonging to different sources such as dislocation
movement, twinning, formation of stacking faults and martensitic phase
transformation. The part on macroscopic strain localizations demonstrates well
that the combination of different in situ characterization techniques such as
digital image correlation, infrared thermography and acoustic emission applied
to the PortevinLe Chatelier effect can gain a deeper knowledge and understanding
on ongoing processes and material behaviour.

Application of spectrally resolved scanning photoluminescence to assess
relaxation processes of InGaAs and InAlAs layers strained in compression and
tension. The objective of this contribution is to demonstrate the utility of
room temperature scanning photoluminescence SPL techniques with high spatial
resolution as an efficient, fast and non destructive approach to study defects
resulting from the relaxation of lattice mismatched epitaxial layers strained in
compression and tension. Experiments were carried out on InGaAs and InAlAs
layers with various compositions and thicknesses grown by molecular beam epitaxy
MBE or metal organic chemical vapour deposition MOCVD on InP001 substrates. We
found that SPL images, which display the spatial distribution of spectrally
integrated photoluminescence intensity from investigated layers, reveal the
presence of extended defects related to the relaxation process e.g. misfit
dislocation, . In addition, spectrally resolved SPL allows to assess lateral
distribution of the bandgap and of the valence band splitting.

electrical properties results showing when nanocomposite film annealed at '20C
produce the lowest current. Meanwhile, when the annealing temperature increased,
the current increased drastically and this indicates the PMMA:TiO2 nanocomposite
film are no longer having insulating properties. The dielectric properties also
indicate that film annealed at has the best dielectric properties compared to
other temperature. The FESEM results show that as the temperature increased, the

Effect of serrated grain boundary on tensile and creep properties of a
precipitation strengthened high entropy alloy. In this study, tensile and creep
deformation of a high-entropy alloy processed by selective laser melting SLM has
been investigated; hot ductility drop was identified at first, and the loss of
ductility at elevated temperature was associated with intergranular fracture. By
modifying the grain boundary morphology from straight to serration, the hot
ductility drop issue has been resolved successfully. The serrated grain boundary
could be achieved by reducing the cooling rate of solution heat treatment, which
allowed the coarsening of L12 structured ' precipitates to interfere with mobile
grain boundaries, resulting in undulation of the grain boundary morphology.
Tensile and creep tests at were conducted, and serrated grain boundary could
render a significant increase in tensile fracture strain and creep rupture life
by a factor of 3.5 and 400, respectively. Detailed microstructure analysis has
indicated that serrated grain boundary could distribute strains more evenly than
that of straight morphology. The underlying mechanism of deformation with grain
boundary serration was further demonstrated by molecular dynamic simulation,
which has indicated that serrated grain boundaries could reduce local strain
concentration and provide resistance against intergranular cracking. This is the
first study to tackle the hot ductility drop issue in a high-entropy alloy
fabricated by SLM; it can provide a guideline to develop future high-entropy
alloys and design post heat treatment for elevated temperature applications.

with relatively low { 0001 } < 11 2 0 > slip and high { 10 1 2 } < 10 1 1 >

poor mechanical properties, especially low ductility. The as-extruded ZM alloy

Effect of stacking sequence and geometric scaling on the brittleness number of
glass fiber composite laminate with stress raiser. The fracture behavior of
quasi-brittle material exhibits commonly brittle behavior with some ductility in
the fracture processing zone. Therefore, a matrix of experimental works is
performed to investigate the failure behaviors based on a parameter known as
brittleness number, which is a measure of brittle behaviors. Glass fiber-
reinforced epoxy laminates of three stacking sequences, cross-ply 0/90/ 2s and
two quasi-isotropic 0/45//90 2s and 0/45//90/-45 s , are manufactured using hand
lay-up technique. A matrix of different specimen geometric scaling with open
hole of the same material is used. The fracture energy G IC and nominal strength
of these composite laminates are measured experimentally using compact tension
test, center crack specimen, and tension test, respectively. The results showed
that the increase of homogeneity of composite laminates, which is introduced by
inserting a certain angle ply for the laminate structure, enhanced the material
ductility as the brittle number increased. The larger size of specimen leads to
the increase of brittleness for the same stacking sequences due to the increase
of stress concentration factor.

Marforming and martempering of a CuZnAl shape memory alloy. A CuZnAl alloy with
Ms=25C has been quenched in liquid nitrogen. A subsequent rolling of the
thermally induced martensite marforming MF at by an amount of =20% provides
oriented and high defect domains. This results in a defect stabilized structure
which can not retransform diffusionless into austenite. Tempering martempering
MT of this martensite is conducted in two ways: 1 Isochronal 1 h at different
temperatures<TMT800C. The material is subsequently water quenched. 2 Heat-up
treatments in a differential scanning calorimeter DSC device with different
heating rates 550 K min1. The microstructural changes caused by these MT
treatments are investigated by optical and transmission electron microscopy. The
course of different precipitation processes -, - and -brass is confirmed by the
DSC heat-up treatments. This results in a timetemperature reaction diagram.

Grain refinement kinetics and strengthening mechanisms in Cu0.3Cr0.5Zr alloy
subjected to intense plastic deformation. The ultrafine-grained microstructures,
mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of a Cu0.3%Cr0.5%Zr alloy
subjected to equal channel angular pressing ECAP at a temperature of to a total
strain of 1, 2, and 4 were investigated. The ultrafine-grained microstructure
resulting from progressive increase in the misorientations of strain-induced
low-angle boundaries during the multiple ECAP process is considered as a type of
continuous dynamic recrystallization. The multiple ECAP process resulted in
substantial strengthening of the alloy. The yield stress of CuCrZr alloy in the
initial solution treated condition ST increased from 65MPa to 476MPa after four
ECAP passes at. For the aged condition AT, the yield stress increased from
170MPa to 511MPa after four passes. The strengthening was attributed to the
grain refinement and high dislocation densities evolved via large strain
deformation. BaconKocksScattergood modification of the Orowan model is
sufficient for acceptable description of the precipitation hardening of AT
specimens during ECAP processing; this finding is in excellent agreement with
the experimental data. The discrepancy between the experiment and model for ST
specimens disappears after taking into consideration additional precipitating of
the supersaturated solid solution during preheating and ECAP processing.

Revisiting the Ostwald Ripening: A Discrete Model Based on Multiple Pairwise
Interactions. A discrete multi-particle model of Ostwald ripening based on
direct pairwise interactions between precipitates with incoherent interfaces is
presented. Although based on the mean field concept, it is a valid alternative
to the classical LSW theory. The main differences with respect to the classical
approach can be summarized as follows: Particles interact the one another; The
first Ficks law is considered to evaluate the fluxes of matter instead of the
quasi stationary solution of the concentration field around particles; The rate
of matter exchange depends on the average surface-to-surface interparticle
distance, a characteristic feature of the system which naturally incorporates
the effect of volume fraction of second phase; The multi-particle diffusion is
described through the definition of an interaction volume containing all the
particles involved in the exchange of solute. The model is in excellent
agreement with the experimental data available in the literature. The shape of
the quasi-stationary 3D particle size distribution of solid-solid and solid-
liquid systems is well predicted from volume fractions of 0.07, 0.30, 0.52 and
0.74. Similarly, a very good prediction of the dependence of the kinetic
constant of the coarsening process on the volume fraction of precipitates is
obtained with reference to literature data on solid-liquid mixtures in the
volume fraction range from 0.20 to about 0.75. For volume fractions below about
0.1 the model predicts broad and right-skewed stationary size distributions
resembling a lognormal function. Above this value, a transition to sharper, more
symmetrical but still right-skewed shapes occurs.

Densification and fine-grain formation mechanisms of BaTiO3 ceramics
consolidated by self-assembly sintering. In this paper, from the perspective of
thermodynamics and kinetics, we have studied the mechanism of balancing the
densification and grain growth via cosintering the micron and nanopowders, also
known as self-assembly sintering. In the experiment, the 200-nm and 80-nm BaTiO3
spherical powders were used as models for combination and cosintering. In terms
of thermodynamics, the contact angle method is applied to determine the free
energy of the binary particle size system. The surface free energy of 200-nm and
80-nm BaTiO3 powders is 51.66 J/mol and 203.47 J/mol, respectively. When the
powder ratio is 1:1, the surface free energy of the binary particle size system
is 127.56 J/mol, which is the reason for the balance between densification and
grain growth. In terms of kinetics, the Arrhenius equation was utilized to
calculate the apparent activation energy Q of the binary particle size system.
The results show that the value of Q is 360 kJ/mol at. The fine-grained ceramics
with high relative density obtained by this sintering method at a low sintering
temperature 1000 C can be explained by the relative low value of Q.

Extraction of Nanocellulose from Dried Rubber Tree Leaves by Acid Hydrolysis.
Nanocellulose were extracted from dried rubber tree leaves by acid hydrolysis.
The dried rubber tree leaves were treated by the alkali and bleaching process to
obtain the bleached cellulose powder. Acid hydrolysis from sulfuric acid H2SO4
at different concentrations 35 wt.% to 65 wt.% was performed to obtain the
nanocellulose. The extracted nanocellulose were characterized by the
transmission electron microscope TEM, atomic force microscope AFM, Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR and X-ray powder diffraction XRD. The
produced nanocellulose exhibited rod-like shaped cellulose nanocrystals however,
thestructure and crystallinity depended on the H2SO4 concentration. It was
revealed that the higher H2SO4 concentration led to the shorterlengths. In
addition, the crystallinity was generally found to increase with increasing acid
concentration treatments but slightly reduce at 65 wt.% of H2SO4.

Prediction of grain growth of coarse-grained austenite in NbVTi microalloyed
steel. Grain growth of coarse-grained austenite in NbVTi microalloyed steel
during equalisation was predicted by extending the previous investigation. The
prediction worked with initial austenite grain size distribution instead of
average grain size. An improved model taking into account the holding time was
used in the prediction. The result showed that only part of initial austenite
grains grow at each equalisation temperatures, but the grain size of growing
grains is expanded to a wider range with increasing equalisation temperature,
which indicates that grain size distribution should be considered when grain
growth of coarse-grained austenite is evaluated. The predicted austenite grain
size distribution is close fit to the measured one and further work is expected
to improve the quality of model prediction.

Numerical Analysis for the Energy Release Rate of Crack in Anisotropic Body
under Combined Loadings.. For a crack in an anisotropic elastic body subjected
to remote inclined load under a plane stress condition, the energy release rate
at the onset of crack kinking is analyzed by numerical analysis. The analysis is
based on the path-independent E-integral using the finite element method. The
E-integral gives the energy release rate at the onset of crack kinking for
hyperelastic bodies. The eight-noded and six-noded isoparametric finite elements
are used and the integral paths lie along the sides of the finite element. The
numerical integration of the E-integral formula can be evaluated directly by
using the nodal forces and nodal displacements. After the path independency is
examined in an isotropic elastic body subjected to the remote constant tension
stress, it is shown that the results for inclined loads agree very well with the
results by Wu 1978. For the anisotropic bodies, in the cases of different planes
of symmetry, the energy release rate is computed first under the perpendicular
loading to the carck surface and then under the inclined loading. For the
former, the results agree well with the perturbation solutions by Gao and Chiu
1992. For the inclined load, the direction of the maximum energy release rate is
more sensitive to the direction of loading than the direction of the plane of
symmetry.

Study on Axial Parameters of Stepped Ferrofluid Seals. a new type of intelligent
material seal technology, ferrofluid seal has been widely used in high speed,
heavy load and large eccentricity occasions in recent years because of its long
life, low leakage and high pressure resistance. Because of the limitation of the
axial height of the axis, most of the existing studies are focused on the radial
parameters, but the specific research on the axial parameters has not yet been
carried out. In this study, the theoretical pressure capabilities of height of
the distribution of axial teeth and axial slot width was calculated according to
the theory of stepped ferrofluid seals by finite element method. And by changing
the radial gap, the stepped ferrofluid seal is compared with the ordinary seal,
and the calculation results are analysed and discussed. The results show that
the distribution mode of the axial teeth has a great influence on the
theoretical sealing pressure resistance. And the theoretical sealing pressure
resistance reaches the maximum when the distribution mode is evenly distributed.
The influence of the width of the axial slot on the theoretical sealing pressure
resistance can be neglected, so the technological property and the design should
be considered as far as possible. By comparing the stepped seal with the
ordinary seal, the practicability of the stepped seal is further verified.

Charged particles: Unique tools to study irradiation resistance of concentrated
solid solution alloys. Both energetic ions and high-energy primary recoils
induce defect processes in complex alloys that are consequences of the spatial
and temporal coupling of atomic displacement processes and energy dissipation
from ionization. Chemical disorder does not monotonically increase with more
alloying elements but can be tuned by specific alloying elements and the
corresponding concentrations. Differences between ions and neutrons need to be
taken when relying on ion beam testing for reactor applications. Many
multicomponent concentrated solid solution alloys including high-entropy alloys
exhibit improved radiation resistance and enhanced structural stability in harsh
environments. To study and assess irradiation resistance of nuclear materials,
energetic ion and electron beams are commonly used to create displacement
damage. Moreover, charged particles of ions, electrons, and positrons are unique
tools to create and characterize radiation effects. Ion beam analysis e.g.,
Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, nuclear reaction analysis, and time-of-
flight elastic recoil detection analysis, electron microscopy techniques e.g.,
transmission or scanning electron microscopy, and electron diffraction, and
positron annihilation spectroscopy have been applied to characterize
irradiatedorto understand defect formation and evolution together with chemical
and microstructural information. Their distinctive analyzing power and some
perspectives in these techniques are reviewed. In developing structural alloys
desirable for applications in advanced reactors, neutron exposure is a critical
test but the limitation in achievable high damage levels is, however, a
bottleneck. Ion irradiation is often used as a surrogate for neutron
irradiation, and the associated reduced transmutations and higher displacements
per atom dpa rates are desirable for materials research. Nevertheless, cautions
need to be taken when relying on ion irradiation results for reactor
evaluations. Literature on differences between ions and neutrons is briefly
reviewed. In addition, the links to bridge the current advances on fundamental
understandings to reactor applications are discussed to lay the groundwork
between neutrons and ions for radiation effects studies.

backscattering spectrometry RRBS for determination of presence of oxygen and for
ion beam mixing analysis. The simulation of RRBS spectra reveals the mixing of
Te and Pb layers with ion irradiation and sputtering of Te and Pb. High-

Investigation of Causes of Wall Thinning during Stamping of Halves of Stamped-
Welded Elbows. In recent years, the oil and gas industries have been developing
significantly. In this regard, there was a great need for the construction of
main pipelines, which consist of pipes and connecting parts. The production of
connecting parts of pipeline has not been studied enough to date. This article
describes the process of stamping halves of stamped-welded elbows. During the
stamping operation, the workpiece wall is thinned. The process of modeling this
operation in a software of modeling by finite element method Deform-3D is
described. The place of the greatest thinning of the wall was determined with
the help of Deform-3D. The results of modeling and experimental production
coincided. The main factors that may influence the degree of thinning were
identified. Experimental calculations were performed in Deform-3D with a
variation of these factors.a result of the experiments carried out, the most
significant factor was determined and an option was proposed to solve the
problem of wall thinning. Solving this problem will help reduce the cost of
production by 1.5 times.

Preparation of Cu/nano-SiC composite powder in disproportionation reaction and
replacement reaction. For the purpose of coating the nano-SiC grain by Cu,the
Cu/nano-SiC composite powders have been prepared by disproportionation reaction
and replacement reaction,respectively.Scanning electron microscope,tunneling
electron microscope and energy-dispersive spectrometer have been applied to
study the micro-morphology,granules aggregating and particles radius,as well as
the weight percent of Cu and SiC of the Cu/nano-SiC composite powders.The
experimental results indicate that the radius of a single Cu/nano-SiC composite
granule is approximately 100 nm.Two areas of a certain Cu/nano-SiC composite
granule have been randomly selected in order to measure the weight percent of
Cu.It has been found that the weight percent of Cu is respectively 37% and 35%
for the two randomly selected area of the Cu/nano-SiC composite powders obtained
by disproportionation reaction,while it is respectively 79% and 25% for that
obtained by replacement reaction.This result indicates that disproportionation
reaction is a more competitive method to coat the nano-SiC grain compared with
the replacement reaction.

Interfacial Friction of Ceramics at High Temperature Ring-Compression Test.
Using ring compression tests, the interfacial friction and flow stress of
3Y-TZP/Al2O3 composite at elevated temperatures were investigated. Theoretical
calibration curves of the friction factor and the relative average pressure
curves for the ring compression tests of 6:3:2 standard rings were drawn based
on a velocity field capable of describing the bulge phenomena. The lubricant was
the boron nitride hexagonal. The tests were adopted at temperature range
of-1600C. Results indicate that the interfacial friction factor has the value in
the range of 0.34-0.49, so that boron nitride lubricant can be used effectively
in present temperatures.two extremely important parameters, the temperature and
strain rate have no significant effect on the fraction factor. It is proved
reliable that the ring-compression test at and even higher is used to evaluate
the performance of boron nitride lubricant.

Mechanical Properties of Cu-4.0wt%Ni-0.95wt%Si Alloys with and without P and Cr
Addition. The effects of P and Cr addition and two-step aging on the
microstructure and mechanical properties of a Cu-4wt%Ni-0.95wt%Si alloy have
been examined. The addition of 0.02wt%P improves both strength and elongation
because it suppresses discontinuous precipitation reaction. The Cr addition to
the CuNiSiP alloy decreases greatly the grain size, resulting in an increase in
elongation. Two-step aging, pre-aging at 300 or and subsequent second-step aging
at, causes an increase in strength without reducing elongation. The increase in
strength is attributable to the decrease in inter-precipitate spacing by the
two-step aging. The two-step aged Cu-4wt%Ni- 0.95wt%Si-0.02wt%P-0.02wt%Cr alloy
attains a tensile strength of 830MPa, an elongation of 13% and an electrical
conductivity of 35%IACS.

Effect of Humidity and Thermal Cycling on Carbon-Epoxy Skin/Aramid Honeycomb
Structure. Many modern military aircraft are constructed from composite and
bonded structure, such as thin carbon-epoxy laminate bonded to Kevlar and Nomex
honeycomb. Operation of these platforms in Australian and global conditions will
subject the structure to potentially high levels of humidity, extremes in
temperature, and for maritime operations, exposure to salt spray conditions. The
thin composite laminate is likely to rapidly absorb moisture in a humid
environment and enable permeation of moisture into the adhesive and core. In
addition to the chemical influence of moisture on the composite structure, the
moisture trapped in the honeycomb structure may freeze and expand with changes
in altitude during operations or simply due to daily temperature fluctuations at
the resident airbase. The combination of moisture ingress in the honeycomb
structure and thermal cycling may lead to deteriorated strength of the honeycomb
panels over time that would not be observed for long term humid exposure alone.
Long term salt water absorption may also have an adverse effect on composites
structures. This study investigates the effects of humid environments and
thermal cycling on the mechanical properties of composite and honeycomb
structures.

Characteristics of InAs/AlSb high electron mobility transistors grown on Si
using a GaAsSb step-graded buffer layer. A GaAsSb step-graded metamorphic buffer
layer is used for growing InAs/AlSb high electron mobility transistor structures
on Si substrate by molecular beam epitaxy. The step-graded metamorphic buffer
layer effectively reduces the number of microtwins and stacking faults
penetrating to the InAs channel as evidenced by transmission electron
microscopy. By reducing the planar defects with the metamorphic buffer layer, a
significant improvement on electron mobility up to 18 100 cm2/V s and 39 700

Temperature dependent resistivity study on zinc oxide and the role of defects.
The temperature dependent 30550C resistivity of zinc oxide ZnO has been studied
by the standard four probe resistivity method. The room-temperature resistivity
of the sample is measured as 0.75Mm. Resistivity versus temperature plot of the
sample shows normal NTCR negative temperature coefficient of resistance behavior
up to. However, a crossover from NTCR to a PTCR positive temperature coefficient
of resistance behavior is observed at. The origin of the PTCR behavior is
explained with the defects present in the ZnO annealed up to. Temperature
dependent S-parameter positron annihilation line-shape parameter indicates the
formation of oxygen vacancy like defects in this temperature region. At the PTCR
region, the activation energy for the electron conduction is calculated 2.6eV.
This value is very close to the theoretically predicted defect level energy of
2.0eV for oxygen vacancies present in ZnO.

Validity and size-dependency of CauchyBorn hypothesis with Tersoff potential in
silicon nano-structures. One of the most popular constitutive rules that
correlate the continuum and atomic properties in multi-scale models is the
CauchyBorn CB hypothesis. Based on this constitutive law of continuum media, it
assumes that all atoms follow the deformation subjected to the boundary of
crystal. In this paper, the validity and failure of CB hypothesis are
investigated for the silicon nano-structure by comparison of the continuum and
atomic properties. In the atomistic level, the stresses and position of atoms
are calculated using the molecular dynamics MD simulation based on the Tersoff
inter-atomic potential. The stresses and strains are compared between the
atomistic and continuous media to obtain the validity of CB hypothesis. The 3D
validity surfaces are derived for various numbers of atoms to display the size-
dependency of cubic specimens. It is shown that the CB is valid inside the
surface, the deformations are homogeneous, and the material is elastic, while
the CB is invalid outside of the surface, the deformations are inhomogeneous,
and the material may remain elastic, or plastic.

organized growth of silicon nanowires by means of a Chemical-Vapor-Deposition
process is investigated using a nanoporous alumina template on a 100 oriented
silicon substrate. The position of the nanowires is determined by the location
of gold colloids, acting as catalysts, which are initially deposited at the
bottom of the pores over large areas of the sample. The direction of growth is
guided by the pore axis, which is perpendicular to the silicon substrate
surface. Results from scanning and transmission electron microscopy are
presented and discussed. 2008 WILEY-VCHVerlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

Physic Simulation of Slurry Preparation by Ultrasonic Vibration in Semisolid
Metal Processing. In current research, a series of visualization experiments
simulating the action of ultrasonic vibration UV in metal slurry preparation
process on fluid flow, grain nucleation and growth as well as its interaction
with viscosity of fluids were conducted. In these visualization experiments, the
metal slurry maker was substituted by a transparent cup while the liquid and
semisolid slurry of metal were replaced by other fluids or mixture system with
similar characteristics. Scaled-up UV was applied to the liquid or mixture
systems. The simulation shows that UV can roll up the particles at the bottom of
the cup and make the liquid convection intense below the radiating surface of
sonotrode while weak above it. UV can break dendrites rapidly and distribute
them in melt. High viscosity reduces the actual power transmitted into liquid,
and higher viscosity requires higher inception power of UV.

The effect of oxidation on fatigue crack growth inr-1Mo steel at: A
metallographic examination. The fatigue cracking characteristics ofr1Mo steel
where the composition is in approximate weight per cent has been studied in air
and vacuum at using high strain and linear elastic fracture mechanics test
specimens. No effect of heat treatment annealed vs. normalized and tempered on
the crack path or fracture surface characteristics was observed. However, a
large effect of environment on the cracking characteristics was found. Flat
fractures resulting from a single unbranched transgranular crack were typical of
all samples tested in air independent of cyclic frequency and cyclic waveform.
Tests in vacuum, however, exhibited cracks with considerable branching,
resulting in a very irregular fracture surface caused by mixed transgranular and
intergranular cracking. Compressive dwell periods appear to cause rewelding at
the crack tip for all tests in vacuum.

Effect of annealing temperature on the properties of spray deposited Cu2SnS3
thin films. Copper tin sulphide Cu2SnS3, a promising solar cell absorber layer
for thin film heterojunction solar cells, was grown onto soda-lime glass
substrates by spray pyrolysis technique. The effect of annealing Cu2SnS3CTS
films in sulphur atmosphere at different annealing temperatures is investigated.
From X-ray diffraction XRD and Raman spectra analysis, it is observed that the
films exhibit polymorphism with tetragonal and monoclinic CTS phases. While the
as-deposited films and the films annealed at 400 and are found to contain
tetragonal as well as monoclinic CTS phases, the films annealed at are found to
be mostly monoclinic CTS. The crystallite size is found to increase from 15 to
40 nm with increase of annealing temperature. From energy dispersive X-ray
spectrometer EDS analysis, the films annealed at 400 and are found to be near-
stoichiometric Cu2SnS3. The direct optical band gap of CTS films with dominant
tetragonal phase is found to be 1.10 eV, while that of films with dominant

A molecular dynamics study of domain switching in BiFeO3 nanofilm under DC
electric field. The performance of ferroelectric materials is deeply rooted in
the domain switching process triggered by an applied electric field. To
understand the effect of controlling factors on the domain switching
characteristics, nanoscale studies are essential. In this work, an atomistic-
scale computational framework is developed to study the domain switching process
of bismuth ferrite BiFeO3 nanofilms. Through a series of molecular dynamics
simulations, the effects of duration and magnitude of an electric field, domain
size and nanofilm thickness on the domain switching behavior are investigated.
The evolution of domains under different magnitudes and durations of the applied
electric field is studied, and the results of unswitched and switched cases are
summarized in a switching map. Analysis of various nanofilms reveals that by
increasing the film thickness, the switching time is increased. Furthermore, the
nanofilms with different domain sizes and configurations are examined, and the
minimum domain size for complete reversal switching is obtained. Our results are
helpful to predict and tune the switching process in ferroelectric materials.

Modelling Crack Growth within Graphite Bricks due to Irradiation and Radiolytic
Oxidation. During operation, nuclear graphite structures are exposed to
gradients of neutron radiation and temperature. They are also prone to
radiolytic oxidation, subsequent porosity changes and weight loss. These
processes cause significant changes in the material properties of graphite and
create complicated stress fields within graphite bricks. Significant efforts
have been made to analyse these stresses over recent years. In this paper, the
influence of stresses within a typical graphite brick, during operation, on
crack growth is studied. A finite element FE mechanical constitutive model is
implemented in ABAQUS as a user-subroutine UMAT in conjunction with a damage
model to simulate crack growth within the graphite brick. The damage model is a
linear traction separation model and it is applied with XFEM enrichment to model
crack initiation and growth. The results indicate that the cracks initiate in
the vicinity of the keyway roots where the maximum principal stress is at its
peak. Complete failure was not observed from the simulation of the graphite
brick under 30 years of irradiation conditions with a maximum brick temperature
of. Computed stresses and crack lengths were found to be largely dependent on
the FE mesh refinement and the results of mesh sensitivity studies are also
presented in this paper.

Development of the laser method of multicrystalline silicion surface
texturization. Purpose: The aim of the paper is to demonstrate a laser method of
multicrystalline silicon texturization. This means creating a roughened surface
so that incident light may have a larger probability of being adsorbed into the
solar cell. It was demonstrated, that laser processing is very promising
technique for texturing multicrystalline silicon independent on crystallographic
orientation of grains compared to conventional texturing methods.
Design/methodology/approach: The topography of laser textured surfaces were
investigated using ZEISS SUPRA 25 scanning electron microscope and LSM 5 Pascal
ZEISS confocal laser scanning microscope. The reflectance of produced textures
was measured by Perkin-Elmer Lambda spectrophotometer with an integrating
sphere. Electrical parameters of manufactured solar cells were characterized by
measurements of IV illuminated characteristics under standard AM 1.5 radiation.
Findings: The texturing of multicrystalline silicon surface using Nd:YAG laser
makes it possible to increase absorption of the incident solar radiation. Laser
processing is a promising method for texturization of multicrystalline silicon
compared to conventional texturing methods applied in used technology of solar
cells. Research limitations/implications: Laser processing introduce into the
bulk of material some unwanted effects, having detrimental influence on the main
parameters of processed silicon wafers. Solar cells manufactured from laser-
textured multicrystalline silicon wafers demonstrate worse electrical
performance than cells manufactured from the non-textured wafers after saw
damage removal as well as wafers textured by etching in alkaline solutions.
Chemical etching by means of potassium alkali made it possible to increase cell
efficiency. Originality/value: Laser texturing has been shown to have great
potential as far as its implementatnion into industrial manufacturing process of
solar cell is concerned.

Our measurements of the electrophoretic velocity of DNA, the elasticity of the

Effect of gate capping configurations and silicon-on-insulator thickness with
external stresses on partially depleted metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
transistors. Silicon nitride gate capping by contact etch-stop layer CESL was
used in this study to induce high and low tensile and compressive stresses on
50-, 70-, and 90-nm-thick silicon-on-insulator SOI n-/p-metal-oxide-
semiconductor field-effect transistors. The devices with thicker SOI show a
higher interface state, particularly the highly strained devices, although they
exhibit higher transconductance. The transconductances of different CESL
configurations are sensitive to the tSOI effect, but the transconductances of
different tSOI are less sensitive to external compressive stress compared with
those of CESL configurations. The CESL-induced compressive devices show higher
piezoresistive coefficients than the tensile CESL devices, yielding an external
stress of up to about 45.7 MPa for both longitudinal and transverse
configurations. This probably results from nonlinear stress-strain relations on
the CESL-induced strained channel.

On characterization of deformation microstructure in Boron modified Ti6Al4V

shown significant improvement in mechanical behavior of materials. In the
present study, electron back-scatter diffraction EBSD techniques have been
applied to investigate the deformation microstructure evolution in boron
modified two-phase titanium alloy Ti6Al4V. The alloy was hot compressed at up to
50% height reduction at two different strain rates 103s1 and 1s1. The EBSD
analyses indicated significant differences in deformed microstructure of the
base alloy and the alloy containing boron. A strong subgrain formation tendency
was observed along with inhomogeneous distribution of dislocations inside large
colonies of Ti64. In contrast, colonies were relatively strain free for Ti64+B,
with more uniform dislocation density distribution. The observed difference is
attributed to microstructural modifications viz. grain size refinement and
presence of TiB particles at grain boundary produced due to boron addition.

Effects of Metal Matrix Composition on the Pre-Sintering Process of CuBased
Metallic Friction Materials. This study investigates the effect of the metal
matrix composition of the friction material on the pre-sintering process through
a simulation experiment on the Sprinkle sintering process. No segregation in the
pre-sintered microstructure of the free-deposited friction material powder and
no cracks are observed at the interface with the steel plate. In the case of a
brass composition containing Zn and trace elements having relatively high vapor
pressure, expansion occurs due to the volatilization of the composition elements
during pre-sintering. On the contrary, in the case of bronze-based powder, the
effect is insignificant. Therefore, when the friction material is manufactured
using the sprinkle sintering method, the matrix composition must be selected in
consideration of the volatilization effect of the metal matrix element.

Enhanced RF to DC converter with LC resonant circuit. Presented in this paper is
an experimental comparison of the conventional and proposed design circuit of a

of antenna and rectifier block for receiving electromagnetic radiation signal
and to produce a DC voltage, respectively. In addition to this conventional
circuit, the proposed design includes LC tank circuit as receiving block of a
well-designed antenna radio frequency receiver. Proper choice of an antenna
type, realizing of point contact Germanium diodes as rectifier and correct
design values for the LC passive components, greatly improved the measurement of
the maximum output power, giving approximately a 100% increase compared to the
conventional method. Experimental results of the enhanced RF to DC converter
measured a maximum output power of 1.80 mWat a distance of 77.84 meters from a

high-pressure torsion HPT for producing an ultrafine-grained structure. The
alloy was further aged for extra strengthening. The tensile strength then
reached a value as high as ~1 GPa. The microstructures were analyzed by
transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. The mechanism for
the high strength was clarified in terms of solid-solution hardening, cluster

is shown that the segregation of solute atoms at grain boundaries including
subgrain boundaries plays a significant role for the enhancement of the tensile

to vary the prior austenite grain size. When oxidised in air at, the grain
boundaries oxidise at higher rates than the areas within the grains, and thus
develop oxide ridges. In addition to this morphological difference these grain
boundary ridges also show compositional dissimilarities from the oxides formed
within the grains, as suggested by the results from analyses using scanning
electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry SIMS at these locations.
Both energy dispersive X-ray analysis and secondary ion imaging confirm the high
Si content of the oxides in the ridges. Oxide ridges and the scales within the
grains of the oxidised alloys having different grain sizes and Si contents have
been extensively characterised by obtaining depth profiles for different
elements using SIMS. An important observation is that there is a synergistic
influence of the grain size and the Si content...

New Concepts in the Design of Tough Ceramics. The brittle nature of ceramics
hinders their applications as structural components. Two alternatives are
adopted to solve the problems 1,2. One alternative refines the processing
details to reduce the flaw size in ceramics. The strength is consequently
enhanced though the toughness remains low. The other approach targets the
toughness improvement through the addition of toughening reinforcement. Ceramic
or metallic reinforcement is incorporated into a ceramic matrix. The
reinforcement interacts with the pre-existing and/or service-induced cracks to
slow down their propagation. The toughness of the brittle matrix is thus
improved through such interactions. Though the strength may be sacrificed
slightly by adopting this approach, the reinforcement also acts as a stress
concentration site. However, the latter approach is attractive, as the
reliability of ceramics during the subsequent usage can be improved
significantly. The development of tough ceramic-matrix composites has been
thoroughly studied since 1982 1. Many ceramic or metallic materials, such as
zirconia 3, SiC whisker 2, nickel 4 and silver 5 have been used as toughening
reinforcements. The presence of these toughening agents enhances the toughness
of ceramics through the generation of various toughening mechanisms. These
toughening mechanisms may be active either in a process zone around the major
crack or in bridging crack surfaces 6. The propagation of cracks is hampered due
to the effect of these mechanisms, resulting in an increase in the toughness of
the ceramics. The presence of a single toughening agent frequently induces more
than one toughening mechanism. For example, the addition of zirconia particles
can induce transformation toughening, microcrack toughening and crack deflection
mechanisms 7. The metallic inclusions can either bridge the crack surfaces
through their plastic deformation 4,5 or deflect the crack 5. These mechanisms
operate simultaneously to a different extent within the brittle matrix. However,
the contribution to toughness from each mechanism has yet to be quantified.
Several theoretical or experimental attempts have been made recently to
differentiate between individual contributions 8,9. These studies assumed that
all the individual contributions to total toughness enhancement could be added
together.

A simplified model for creep induced grain boundary cavitation validated by
multiple cavity growth simulations. Modelling and simulation of grain boundary
cavitation under creep conditions. Considering multiple cavity growth,
nucleation, coalescence and sintering. Evolution equations to describe
cavitation behaviour through two global variables. Simulations of cavitation
processes on a grain boundary under creep conditions have been carried out,
taking into account nucleation, growth, coalescence and sintering of multiple
cavities. Cavity growth rates have been calculated through a resolution
procedure based on the use of holomorphic complex functions. Three dimensionless
parameters have been identified that are responsible for the cavitation
development. Parameter studies have been carried out in order to characterise
the mechanisms that are responsible for the cavitation development. These
studies have been used to develop a physically motivated, simplified model in
order to describe the cavitation development of the simulations in terms of
global state variables. The simplified model is able to reproduce the cavitation
development for all considered combinations of the dimensionless parameters and
allows the description of the thickening behaviour of a cavitating grain
boundary.

Experimental investigation on electrical discharge machining of ceramic
composites Si<SUB align="right">3N<SUB align="right">4-TiN using RSM. In this
work, electrical discharge machining EDM of silicon nitride-titanium nitride
Si3N4TiN composites which have wide application in heat exchangers, wear-
resistant parts, and gas turbines were carried out. Si3N4TiN composites are
fabricated by hot pressing and spark plasma sintering SPS process. Selection of
appropriate machining parameters in EDM is one of the most important aspects
taken into consideration as these conditions to determine the important
characteristics such as material removal rate MRR and electrode wear rate EWR
among others. The main machining parameters such as gap voltage 5+, current 1+
and pulse-on time Ton were chosen to determine listed technological
characteristics. The characteristic features of the EDM process are explored
through response surface methodology RSM based on design of experiments DOE.
Moreover, L18 orthogonal array based on DOE to conduct of series of experiments
has been adopted. From the results, it is evident that the current is the most
significant factor as it influences both MRR and EWR. The high current increases
the MRR and the less gap voltage reduces the EWR. The square profile machined
with the voltage - 50 volts, current - 5 amps and pulse-on time - 500 sec
exhibits high MRR.

Low-temperature magnetic properties of erbium doped bismuth nano-ferrites.
Nanocrystalline pure and erbium Er3+-substituted bismuth ferrite nanoparticles
were synthesized by the citrate-gel auto-combustion method. Prepared powders
were sintered at for five hours in the air and characterized by XRD, TEM, and
HR-TEM. X-ray diffraction XRD analysis showed the distorted rhombohedral
structure of the ferrites. The surface morphology and particle size of the
samples were observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The
lattice parameter, crystalline size, X-ray density has been calculated from
d-spacing. The perceived results can be explained depending on doping
concentration. The temperature dependence of magnetic properties of BiEr
nanoparticles was carried out by using a vibrating sample magnetometer VSM. The

Effects of local processing parameters on microstructure, texture, and
mechanical properties of electron beam powder bed fusion manufactured Ti6Al4V.
Electron beam powder bed fusion scan strategies for parts or part groupings of
various sizes and scan line lengths have been found to inadvertently lead to
significant variations in crystallographic texture and mechanical properties for
Ti6Al4V. This occurs over a range of scan line length that is well below the
maximum scan line length recommended by the electron-beam powder bed fusion
machine manufacturer. The microstructural attributes such as lath thickness,
prior grain size, and phase fraction were similar for materials fabricated under
short and long scan line length conditions, but the crystallographic textures
varied considerably. Electron backscatter diffraction measurements indicate the
basal pole 0001 was strongly aligned with the build direction for long scan line
length conditions, whereas 11 2 0 were aligned with the build direction for
short scan line length conditions. Subsequent prior reconstructions indicate a
preference for alignment of 110 and 100 with build direction for long and short
scan line length conditions, respectively. Both yield and ultimate tensile
strengths along the build direction were approximately 8% higher for long scan
line lengths, consistent with the observed differences in texture. The impact of
a sub-solvus hot isostatic pressing was also investigated, however, this did not
significantly change the textures of as-built materials or the relative
strengths for the two processing conditions.

Compressive properties of porous TiAl alloys fabricated by reaction synthesis
using a space holder powder. We attempted to produce a porous Ti20at% Al alloy
by pressure-sintering of a mixed powder of Ti and Al with a NaCl space holder to
achieve porosity of 60%. As-sintered specimens exhibited an inhomogeneous
microstructure consisting of Ti particles surrounded by a TiAl alloy layer.
However, a nearly single-phase Ti3Al microstructure appeared in the porous
specimen heat-treated at, which shows high plateau-stress level of approximately
100MPa resulting in high absorption energy. Thus, controlling the microstructure
for the formation of the Ti3Al single-phase would be effective to achieve high
energy absorption capacity of the porous TiAl alloy.

Superior cryogenic toughness of high-Mn austenitic steel by welding thermal
cycles: The role of grain boundary evolution. The high-Mn austenitic steel is
expected to improve mechanical properties by grain boundary adjustment. The role
of grain boundary on cryogenic toughness of high-Mn austenitic steel subjected
to various welding thermal cycle was investigated by the means of instrumented
Charpy V-notch impact tests and electron backscatter diffraction EBSD analysis.
The absorbed energy of samples at decreased from 203J to 163J with the increase
of peak temperature from to. When the peak temperature increased to, and, the
absorbed energy of sample increased to 185J, 204J and 196J, respectively. Phase
transformation and abnormal grain growth were absent in the samples. The lowest
cryogenic toughness in sample with the peak temperature of was thus attributed
to the highest proportion of the special grain boundary 3. Furthermore, during
the cryogenic impact test, the crack formation energy was corresponded to the
proportion change of the low angle boundary. While, the crack propagation energy
was closely related to the proportion change of special grain boundary of 3
rather than the high fraction of 3 by welding thermal cycle. It is proposed that
the increasing low angle boundary of 25 and the activation 3 special grain
boundary are responsible for the superior cryogenic toughness for high-Mn
austenitic steel.

Using a scalar parameter to trace dislocation evolution in atomistic modeling. A
scalar c-parameter is proposed from the Nye tensor. Its maximum value occurs
along a dislocation line, either straight or curved, when the coordinate system
is purposely chosen. This parameter can be easily obtained from the Nye tensor
calculated at each atom in atomistic modeling. Using the c-parameter, a fully
automated approach is developed to determine core atoms and the Burgers vectors
of dislocations simultaneously. The approach is validated by revealing the
smallest dislocation loop and by tracing the whole formation process of
complicated dislocation networks on the fly. C2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights

thickness. In addition to this, surface finish of the non-anodized and anodized
specimens was also compared. It was found out that surface finish of the

curable epoxy resin and powders of silica-coated gold nanoparticles. The silica-

Creep behaviour of Ti3Al-based titanium aluminide alloys containing molybdenum.
Titanium aluminide alloys based on the intermetallic 2 phase, Ti3Al, are
potential replacement materials for conventional titanium and nickel alloys in
future gas turbine engines. This paper describes work carried out on the creep
behaviour of two Ti3Al alloys, Ti-23Al-9Nb-2Mo-0.9Si and
Ti-23Al-9Nb-2Mo-2V-0.9Si, tested in the temperature range. Results are compared
with the conventional titanium alloy IMI834. The Ti3Al-based alloys have greatly
enhanced creep strength, the equivalent of up to increase in temperature
capability. Creep strain accumulation has been modelled using the Graham-Walles
equation, and predictions show a good fit to the experimental data over the full
range of temperatures and stresses. For given creep life, the Ti3Al-based alloys
have a relatively high primary creep strain, which must be considered during
component design if the alloys are to be used to their full potential.

Simulating changes of packing structures, locally loading states and mechanical
behaviors for Si lattices with double vacancies at elevated temperatures. The
vacancy defects in silicon matrix have important influences on processing or
manufacturing novel microelectronic devices as well as their performances
related to structures and mechanical properties. Molecular dynamics simulations
were performed for the evolution of the atomic packing structures and locally
loading states as well as tensile tests for silicon matrixes having three types
of double vacancies at atomic scale. Through analysis from Young's modulus,
Poisson's ratios, Lode-Nadai parameters and atomic strain energy density as well
as visually packing images, the simulation results show that there exists just
one type of adjacent vacancies at room temperature, and the external energy
provided from high temperature results in vacancy's migration. On heating, the
matrixes having vacancies present apparent different stages from elasticity to
plasticity, and their temperature regimes are identified. Under applying
uniaxial tension at room temperature, the strain energy density of the matrix
near the vacancies is significantly higher than those in the other regions in
the elasticity stage. There are differences of the elongation and tensile
strength of the matrixes having different types of vacancies.

Characterization of pn structures grown by sublimation heteroepitaxy of-SiC on
6HSiC. A study on forward IV characteristics of pn structures grown by
sublimation heteroepitaxy of-SiC on 6HSiC shows that about 90% of all the diodes
can be placed in two groups. Currentvoltage IV characteristics of type I diodes
are close to those of high-perfection pn homostructures based on bulk-SiC, with
some indications of tunneling currents. IV characteristics of type II diodes are
close to those of pn homostructures grown by epitaxial methods on single-crystal
6HSiC substrates. Diodes of both types emit in the entire visible spectral
range. The longer-wavelength emission is predominant in type I diodes, and
shorter-wavelength emission in type II diodes. However, the main feature of the
injection electroluminescence IEL is the qualitative similarity of the IEL
spectra for diodes of both types. In particular, the IEL spectra of both diode
types contain two bands with h max 2.3 and 2.9 eV, attributed to free exciton
annihilation in-SiC and 6HSiC, respectively.

Effect of vanadium and austenitising temperature on hardenability of 0203C16Mn
steels with and without additions of titanium, aluminium, and molybdenum. The
hardenability of steels containing 0203%C, 16%Mn, up to 03%V all wt-%, and
microalloying additions of Ti, Al, or Mo has been examined using the standard
Jominy test, the results from which were used to calculate the ideal critical
diameters. For each steel composition, the relationship between the ideal
critical diameter and austenitising temperature in the temperature range was
established. For chosen austenitising temperatures, the multiplying
hardenability factors for vanadium were calculated. The experimental results are
discussed on the basis of a proposed model concerning the mechanism of
hardenability, particularly applicable to microalloyed steels.MST/695

Nanoprecipitation of polymeric nanoparticle micelles based on
2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine MPC with 2-diisopropylaminoethyl
methacrylate DPA, for intracellular delivery applications. Biodistribution of
nanoparticle-based intracellular delivery systems is mediated primarily by
particle size and physicochemical properties.such, overcoming the rapid removal
of these by the reticuloendothelial system remains a significant challenge. To
date, a number of copolymer nanoparticle systems based on 2-methacryloyloxyethyl
phosphorylcholine MPC with 2-diisopropylaminoethyl methacrylate DPA, displaying
biomimetic and pH responsive properties, have been published, however these have
been predominately polymersome based, whilst micelle systems have remained
relatively unexplored. This study utilised nanoprecipitation to investigate the
effects of solvent and buffer choice upon micelle size and polydispersity, and
found using methanol produced monodisperse micelles of circa 70 nm diameter,
whilst ethanol produced polydisperse systems with nanoparticles of circa 128 nm
diameter. The choice of aqueous buffer, dialysis of the systems, extended
storage, and exposure to a wide temperature range 5-70 C had no significant
effect on micelle size, and the systems were highly resistant to dilution,
indicating excellent colloidal stability. Optimisation of the nanoprecipitation
process, post precipitation, was investigated, and model drugs successfully
loaded whilst maintaining system stability. Subsequent in vitro studies
suggested that the micelles were of negligible cellular toxicity, and an
apparent cellular uptake was observed via confocal laser scanning microscopy.
This paper presents the first report of an optimised nanoprecipitation
methodology for the formation of MPC-DPA nanoparticle micelles, and in doing so
achieved monodisperse systems with the size and physicochemical characteristics
seen as desirable for long circulating therapeutic delivery vehicles.

SiO2/SiCInterface Traps Probed by Nanoscale Analyses and Transient Current and
Capacitance Measurements. This paper aims to give an overview on some relevant
aspects of the characterization of the SiO2 /4HSiC interface, considering the
properties of this system both at the interface and inside the insulator.
Nanoscale scanning probe microscopy SPM techniques were used to get insights on
the homogeneity of the SiO2 /SiC interface electrical properties upon metal-
oxide-semiconductor MOS processing. On the other hand, capacitance and current
measurements as a function of time were employed to investigate trapping states
in MOS structures in the SiO2 /4HSiC system. In particular, time-dependent gate
current measurements gave information on the near interface oxide trapspresent

Ceramic Tiles Obtained from Clay Mixtures with the Addition of Diverse
Metallurgical Wastes. The generation of industrial residues is unavoidable, but
these materials may be recovered, redirecting them toward new production
processes, rather than allocating them to the stream of discards. The aim of
this paper is to study the feasibility of utilization of metallurgical wastes as
raw material for tiles in the ceramic industry, using the residual materials as
aggregates in clay based ceramics. The residues used are: sludge and slag from
several metallurgical processes, Ruthner dust and foundry sand. Samples were
obtained from mixtures of clay and each waste in various percentages, which were
then heat treated. The pieces obtained were characterized using several
techniques, with the aim of determining the properties of these materials in
relation to the commercial requirements. A high feasibility of reuse of most of
these wastes as raw material in the production of ceramic bodies has been
established.

Colloidal dispersion of gold nanorods: Historical background, optical
properties, seed-mediated synthesis, shape separation and self-assembly. The
color of colloidal dispersions of gold particles in a fluid, typically water,
varies from red to blue, depending upon the shape and size of particles. The
color and optical properties of gold nanoparticles originate from localized
surface plasmons, and are sensitive to their local dielectric environment.
Unlike nanospheres, the optical properties, hydrodynamic behavior as well as
phase behavior of nanorods are influenced by their shape anisotropy. Thus, rods
have an additional absorption peak, possess very different dynamics affects
sedimentation and their concentrated dispersions form liquid crystalline phases.
In this review, we focus on presenting the essential shape dependent optics, as
well as the hydrodynamics and phase behavior of rod-like gold nanoparticles. We
reveal our methodology for making less polydisperse nanorods sols by using an
optimized seed-mediated synthesis controlled chemistry, followed by shape
separation by centrifugation based on our hydrodynamics arguments. We elucidate
the role of Brownian motion in determining colloidal stability and sedimentation
behavior, and describe patterns formed by drying mediated assembly on glass
slides and TEM grids. We outline early studies before 1930 of gold sols that are
not only instructive in learning about synthesis and physical properties of gold
nanoparticles, but show how the study of colloidal gold established many key
principles in colloidal science.

Investigations of structural defects by etching of GaSb grown by the liquid-
encapsulated Czochralski technique. This paper reports results of an
investigation of the behaviour of several etchants in revealing structural
defects in Al-, Te-, Cd- and Te/Cd-doped GaSb. Etchants previously suggested for
GaSb, as well as two etchants developed for GaAs and InP, were tested and
modified in an attempt to establish the best conditions under which a given
etchant may be used and what defects it is likely to reveal. Both the solutions
consisting of H2O2 -H2SO4 and 3%Br-methanol provided reproducible etch figures
on dislocations, the former on the 111Ga, 111Sb, 100 and 110 planes, and the
latter only on the 111Ga plane. In contrast, H2O2 -HC1 and HC1HNO3 -H2O did not
perform satisfactorily in revealing dislocations in the analyzed samples. Using
permanganate etchant, it was possible to observe growth striations only in the
n-type GaSb. The CrO3 -HF solution revealed growth striations on both the p-type
and the n-type GaSb as well as defects formed due to constitutional
supercooling. A new etchant, based on ceric sulfate, was developed to delineate
growth striations along the Te-doped GaSb crystals.

scanning electron microscope SEM. The results show that the volume fraction of
Ti3SiC2 varies with the increasing amount of silicon carbide in the raw
material, peaking at 85.4%. The flexural strength increases from 41117.9MPa to
54717.9MPa with the increasing amount of silicon carbide. However, there is no
significant change in compressive strength and fracture toughness. The Vickers

Modelling of microstructural evolution in multi-layered overlay coatings.
Functionally graded, multi-layered coatings are designed to provide corrosion
protection over a range of operating conditions typically found in industrial
gas turbines. A model incorporating diffusion, equilibrium thermodynamics and
oxidation has been developed to simulate the microstructural evolution within a
multi-layered coating system. The phase and concentration profiles predicted by
the model have been compared with an experimental multi-layered system
containing an Al-rich outer layer, a Cr-enriched middle layer and an MCrAlY-type
inner layer deposited on a superalloy substrate. The concentration distribution
and many microstructural features observed experimentally can be predicted by
the model. The model is expected to be useful for assessing the microstructural
evolution of multilayer coated systems which can be potentially used on
industrial gas turbine aerofoils.

Cytocompatibility evaluation of microwave sintered biphasic calcium phosphate
scaffolds synthesized using pH control. Compounds belonging to the calcium
phosphate CaP system are known to be major constituents of bone and are
bioactive to different extents in vitro and in vivo. Their chemical similarity
makes them prime candidates for implants and bone tissue engineering scaffolds.
CaP nanoparticles of amorphous hydroxyapatite aHA and dicalcium phosphate
dihydrate DCPD were synthesized using chemical precipitation. Uniaxially pressed
aHA and DCPD powders were subjected to microwave radiation to promote solid
state phase transformations resulting in crystalline hydroxyapatite HA,
tricalcium phosphate TCP and biphasic compositions: HA/TCP and TCP/calcium
pyrophosphate CPP and their subsequent densification. Phase composition of
microwave sintered compacts was confirmed via X-ray diffraction XRD and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR. Solution pH during crystal growth was
found to have a profound effect on particle morphology and post-sintered phases,
despite constant sintering temperature. Cytocompatibility assessment using 7F2
cells, corresponding to adult mouse osteoblasts, on microwave and conventional,
furnace sintered samples demonstrated that manufacturing method does not impact
cellular viability after 24 h or proliferation over 7 days. New CaP deposition
and extracellular matrix components were observed in vitro via scanning electron

Cooling slope casting to obtain thixotropic feedstock II: observations with A356
alloy. New Rheocasting NRC is a recently developed semisolid processing route.
There are two versions of this route. In one, molten alloy is poured directly
into a mould and through careful temperature control during cooling a spheroidal
semisolid microstructure is achieved, before the material in the mould is
upended into a shot sleeve and hence forced into a die. Alternatively, the
molten alloy is poured onto a cooling slope and thence into a mould before
processing. The aim of the work described in this paper, and its companion, was
to develop the understanding of the microstructural development during the
initial stages of this process,e. in the mould before processing and with the
cooling slope/mould combination. In the previous paper, an analogue system based
on aqueous ammonium chloride has been used to visualise what happens when an
alloy is poured into a tilted mould with a chill wall, which acts to mimic the
mould and the cooling slope in the NRC process. In this companion paper, the
results for pouring A356 aluminium alloy directly into a mould, and also via a
cooling slope into a mould, are presented.

Structural Properties of BiContaining InPFilms Explored by Cross-Sectional
Scanning. The structural properties of highly mismatched IIIV semiconductors
with small amounts of Bi are still not well understood at the atomic level. In
this chapter, the potential of cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy
X-STM to address these questions is reviewed. Special attention is paid to the
X-STM contrast of isovalent impurities in the IIIV system, which is discussed on
the basis of theoretical STM images of the 110 surface using density functional
theory DFT calculations. By comparing high-resolution X-STM images with
complementary DFT calculations, Bi atoms down to the third monolayer below the
InP110 surface are identified. With this information, the Short-range ordering
of Bi is studied, which reveals a strong tendency toward Bi pairing and
clustering. In addition, the occurrence of Bi surface segregation at the
interfaces of an InP/InP\_{1-x}\Bi\_{x}\/InP quantum well with a Bi

Improved microstructure heterogeneity and low-temperature fracture toughness of
CMn weld metal through post weld heat treatment. The Crack Tip Opening
Displacement CTOD test was used to investigate the effect of post-weld heat
treatment PWHT on the low-temperature fracture toughness of CMn weld metal. The
microstructure observations, instrumented nano-indentation test and
microstructure-based finite element simulation were conducted to analyze the
toughening mechanisms. The study found that the CTOD value increased
significantly from 0.241mm to 1.754mm after PWHT. The hardness and strength
between acicular ferrite AF and proeutectoid ferrite PF both get closer, which
improves the extent of microstructure heterogeneity. The simulation indicated
that the distributions of the strain and stress on AF and PF are homogenized
with the improvement of microstructure coordination after PWHT, making the level
of plastic strain localization within PF decreased and the stress concentration
on the interphase of AF and PF lessened.a result, the resistance of crack
initiation and propagation increases, and the low-temperature fracture toughness
is improved. Moreover, the dislocation densities in AF and PF both decrease, the
dislocation morphology evolves from dislocation tangles into movable dislocation
lines, and amounts of fine carbides precipitate and spheroidize, which also
contribute to the toughening of microstructures.

EIS Study of High-Temperature Oxide Films on a Stainless Steel 253MA- Influence
of Alloying Elements. Alloying elements such as chromium, silicon and cerium in
stainless steels are important for the oxidation behavior of the material at
high temperatures. In this work, the oxide films formed on a stainless steel
253MA with a small variation in the content of chromium, silicon and cerium,
were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS, after exposure
up to 100 hours in air at 750 and. The EIS spectra suggest a two-layer feature
of the oxide films, in agreement with complementary surface analysis. The
influence of a small variation in alloying element content on the oxidation
behavior was revealed by the difference in the electrical properties of the
oxide films. At, the influence becomes pronounced after 100 hours of oxidation,
and the steel with a lower content of chromium, silicon and cerium exhibits a
lower film resistance. At, the oxide film formed on the steel with a lower
content of chromium, silicon and cerium starts to degrade earlier than that on
the steel with a higher content of chromium, silicon and cerium.

Neutron Residual Strain Surface Scans - Experimental Results and Monte Carlo
Simulations. Precise determination of diffraction peak positions is of
particular importance for the evaluation of residual strains. Neutrons are
commonly used to probe residual strains from material volumes in depths of
several millimetres under the sample surface. However, neutron strain analyses
are critical for the near surface region. When scanning close to a sample
surface, aberration peak shifts arise, which can be of the same order as the
peak shifts related to residual strains 1. Series of Monte Carlo M.C.
simulations using the software package RESTRAX/SIMRES 2 were carried out to
simulate the peak shift as a function of gauge volume depth, monochromator
curvature and other instrumental parameters, which can be used to quickly
optimise the experimental setup for direct measuring residual strains near the
sample surface at an arbitrary surface orientation. The M.C. simulations were
compared and agree very well with the experimental data, not only for a stress
free steel sample but as well for a deep rolled steel sample, measured at the
STRESS-SPEC diffractometer at the research reactor FRM II, Garching Germany.

Hardness and Case Depth Analysis Through Optimization Techniques in Surface
Hardening Processes. Surface engineering and surface engineered materials find
wide applications in engineering industries in recent years. Inconsistency in
hardness and case depth has resulted in the further optimization of the process
variables involved in surface hardening. In the present study, the following
operating parameters viz. preheating, carbon potential, holding position,
furnace temperature, carburising time, quenching medium, quenching temperature,
quenching time, tempering temperature and tempering time were taken for
optimization using the Taguchi and Factorial design of experiment concepts. From
the experiments and optimization analysis conducted on EN29 and EN34 materials
it was observed that furnace temperature and quenching time had equal influence
in obtaining a better surface integrity of the case hardened components using
gas carburizing. Preheating before gas carburizing further enhanced the surface
hardness and the depth of hardness. In the case of induction hardening process,
power potential played a vital role in optimizing the surface hardness and the
depth of hardness.

The Use of a.c. Techniques in the Study of Corrosion and Passivity. This chapter
describes the application of electrode impedance analysis to kinetic studies of
corrosion, passivation, and the passivity process. One of the most classical and
easy methods for studying the electrode kinetics is the plotting of the steady-
state current-potential polarization curve. This curve shows the overall
reaction rate, according to Faraday's laws, with respect to potential. For a
very simple electrode processfor example, a single electron transfer reactionthe
steady-state polarization curve allows the electrode kinetics to be analyzed
thoroughly. However, electrochemical systems are much too intricate to be
investigated by this method alone. To acquire further experimental information
about electrode kinetics, various nonsteady-state methods are introduced. In
these methods, time plays the role of an additional parameter to the current and
the potential. Among nonsteady-state techniques such as chronovoltammetry,
chronoamperommetry, and cyclic voltammetry, impedance methods are characterized
by the use of a perturbing electrical signal whose amplitude is vanishingly
small, that is, the interfacial electrical characteristics are linearized.

Microstructure and mechanical property of novel L12 nanoparticles-strengthened
CoFeNi-based medium entropy alloys. A novel L12 nanoparticles-strengthened
CoFeNi84Ti8V8 medium entropy alloy MEA is fabricated. It has typically equiaxed
grains mean grain size: 65 m in which the near-spherical L12 particles mean
size: 23 nm are uniformly distributed with a volume fraction of 45%. This L12
nanoparticle is identified as the novel Ni,Co,Fe3Ti,V phase. CoFeNi84Ti8V8 MEA
has an excellent combination of high yield strength 950 MPa and ultimate tensile
strength 1394 MPa and good ductility 25%. Compared to single-phase fcc CoFeNi
base alloy, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of CoFeNi84Ti8V8
MEA increase by 428% and 215%, respectively. This is mainly attributed to the
precipitation strengthening of L12 nanoparticles. The dimple features in the
fracture surface imply a good ductility. Moreover, the main deformation mode is
dominated by dislocation slips and microbands.

Effect of Co doping on structural, morphological, electrical and optical
properties of nanocrystalline zinc oxide films. &nbsp; We report the effect of
cobalt doping on the structural, morphological, electrical and optical
properties of nanocrystalline ZnO films febricated by chemical spray pyrolysis
technique CSPT. The structural studies reveals that films have strongly c-axis
oriented wurtzite structure. However with the increase at 5% in Co doping
percentage, an inclination from 0 0 2 to 1 0 1 orientation has been observed.
This may be due to the fact that, in addition to substitutional sites, Co may
start to occupy interstitial sites due to the deformation of lattice structure
caused by substitution of nearby Zn atoms by other Co atoms. This will also
result in an increase of lattice constant. The films appear to be homogeneous
and single-phase material, where cobalt enters the ZnO structure as
Co2+&nbsp;rather than forming metallic clusters. Self-assembly of particles are
clearly displayed in&nbsp;Atomic Force&nbsp;Microscope&nbsp;AFM&nbsp;micrograph.
The particle size and roughness of the films are found to decrease with the
increase in Co doping percentage. Optical transmittance spectra showed red shift
at higher doping. A sharp increase in transmittance occurs at 375 nm for all
films, which correspond to band edge absorption. In addition to the band edge,
absorption bands are also observed for all Co doped samples at 573, 606 and 666
nm, which are attributed to d-d transitions of tetrahedrally coordinate Co2+.
The absolute strength of these absorption bands increases almost linearly with
the increase in Co concentrations. Band gap values are found in the interval
between 3.26 to 3.16 eV. Resistance are found to decrease at 15% of Cobalt
doping. &nbsp; Key words:&nbsp;ZnO, Co, Chemical Spray Pyrolysis Technique

Computational study of Fe3O4 adsorption behaviour on the secondary side of the
heat exchange tube in the steam generator. Based on the scaling problem on the
outer surface of the steam generator tube in the secondary circuit condition of
pressurized water reactor, the molecular dynamic was used to calculate the
adsorption characteristics of Fe3O4. The trajectory, mean squared displacement,
radial distribution function and adsorption energy of Fe3O4 agglomeration and
deposition process were further analyzed through variation of temperature and
concentration. When the temperature was between and, the diffusion coefficient
of Fe2+ and OH could reach the minimum value of 2.255cm2/s and 2.638cm2/s,
respectively. During variation of Fe2+ concentration, the size of agglomerate
particles increased continuously, and the diffusion coefficient of H2O can reach
the minimum value of 3.78cm2/s. Fe2+ with positive charges can effectively
agglomerate with H2O and OH, forming the tetrahedral and octahedral structures
of Fe3O4 crystal. At this time, a small number of OH were adsorbed at the
interface of the matrix, forming the double electrical layer and affecting the
deposition of agglomerated Fe3O4. Apart from this, high temperature is
beneficial to inhibit scaling deposition in part. Likewise, low concentration of
the dissolved Fe2+ and OH can also lead to weaker deposition of agglomerated
Fe3O4 on the outer scaling layer of the secondary side in the steam generator.

Formation of high strength MgCuZnY alloys. Quaternary Mg90Cu0.667Y0.33310xZnx
x=1.5, 3, 6 alloys, have been prepared by copper mold casting. Among these
alloys, Mg90Cu0.667Y0.33310xZnx x=6 alloy exhibits high ultimate compressive
strength, over 700MPa, and pronounced compressive plasticity, as high as 11.7%.
X-ray diffraction XRD, scanning electron microscopy SEM and transmission
electron microscope TEM analysis reveal that the improvement of mechanical
properties in the Mg base alloy is attributed to the formation of fine -Mg
dendrite and ternary eutectic phase -Mg+Cu2Mg+CuMgZn. It is also found that

Magnetic properties of polymer matrix composites filled with ferrite powders.
Purpose: The aim of this paper was to present magnetic properties research
results of polymer matrix composites. The influence of the kind of fillers and
amount of fillers on the magnetic properties of the composites was studied and
is presented in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: Epoxy resin filled with
three different amounts 15%, 25% and 35%vol. of filler and three kinds of
ferrite powders were prepared by gravitational casting in order to obtain
gradient polymer matrix composites. Magnetic properties of polymeric composites
were measured by SQUID magnetometer MPMS XL7 Quantum Design. All measurements
were carried out in the temperature and magnetic field up to 7 T. Findings: The
research findings showed that addition of ferrite powders to epoxy resin caused
increased values of magnetic remanence. Moreover it was observed that the higher
values of remanence were for polymer composites with anisotropic filler than
that with isotropic. Research limitations/implications: Presented studies have
been limited to the content of 35%vol. of filler because of difficulties with
casting of higher filled composites. Higher value of filler content caused
dramatic increase of viscosity. Practical implications: Magnetic composites with
different content of magnetic filler are still investigated by scientists in
order to improve magnetic properties of composite materials, which are used in
various industries.

Damping characterization and its underlying mechanisms in CNTs/AZ91D composite
processed by cyclic extrusion and compression. The proper combination of
strength and damping performance has been a major challenge for the wide use of
Mg alloys/composites in many fields. In this regard, this research focused on
the effect of the CEC process and theaddition on the damping behavior of AZ91D
alloy. The damping capacity of CEC-processed CNTs/AZ91D composite is
significantly improved compared with the initial solid-solution state. Also,
although 0.5wt% addition ofto AZ91D decreases the room-temperature damping of
the base alloy, its performance can be improved by the addition of 2.0wt%
Besides, the addition of regardless of its amount regularly increases the high-
temperature damping behavior compared to the base alloy. For the solid-solution
alloy/composite, when the test temperature is lower than the critical
temperature, the damping is mainly advanced by the movement of dislocations
between a large number of weak pinning points and a low amount of strong pinning
points. Contrarily, the damping mechanism of the same material at higher than
critical temperatures is mainly progressed by grain boundary sliding.

Improvement of Wear Corrosion Characteristics of GUMMETAL in Quasi-human Body
Environment by Surface Modification. Recently, the operating number of the
artificial joint tends to increase gradually. Titanium alloys such as Ti-6Al-4V,
Ti-6Al-7Nb and so on were well known as material used for biomedical devices.
These materials were used for the reasons of having superior corrosion
resistance, excellent specific strength and excellent biocompatibility. However
these materials have inferior wear corrosion characteristics. For this reason,
surface modification was required. GUMMETALTi-23Nb-0.7Ta-2ZrO, which is one of
titanium alloys, has low elastic modulus comparable to that of the bone, this
material shows superior mechanical compatibility. At present, wear corrosion
characteristics of GUMMETAL were not fully understood comprehensively both from
wear and corrosion behaviors. Therefore in this study, wear corrosion
characteristics of GUMMETAL were evaluated comprehensively both from wear and
corrosion characters of this material and some trials for improving wear
corrosion characteristics by high temperature in air oxidation were conducted.a
result, wear corrosion behavior was well understood from the viewpoint of the
mutual interaction of wear and corrosion. And also, the improvement in both of
wear and corrosion characteristics was recognized in case when high temperature
in air oxidation was applied to the surface of specimen.

Characterizing the tensile behavior of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V using
multiscale digital image correlation. The tensile behavior of an additively
manufactured AM Ti-6Al-4V alloy is examined at multiple length scales using two-
dimensional digital image correlation DIC techniques. The work focuses on
characterizing the relationship between microstructure and bulk mechanical
properties of the AM Ti-6Al-4V specimens and understanding how unique
microstructural features pertaining to AM metals, such as columnar grain
morphology and nonequilibrium phase structures, influence deformation behavior
at the microscale i.e., the length scales of those features. Lower magnification
in situ DIC experiments were performed at the macroscale during tension
experiments to assess the bulk properties, and a higher magnification ex situ
DIC study was performed at the microscale using a microscope to observe
heterogeneous strain accumulation at that scale. At the macroscale, the AM
Ti-6Al-4V exhibited greater strength than conventionally processed Ti-6Al-4V,
due to its acicular, or needle-like, grain structure. At the microscale,
alternating regions of high and low strains were observed to accumulate along
these needles, or laths. The effects of build orientations related to
microstructure anisotropy, powder bed layering thicknesses 30 and 60m, and heat
treatment, on the properties were also examined. A decrease in strength was
observed in samples subjected to annealing heat treatment compared to as-built
specimens with no heat treatment. Also, the AM specimens exhibited higher
tensile strength when the direction of applied load was perpendicular to the AM
build orientation. This observed anisotropy is thought to be related to
interfaces of consecutively deposited layers because regions of high strain at
the microscale were observed to accumulate at changes in structure associated
with the deposition of layers.

GalliumBoronPhosphide $$\hbox {GaBP}_{2}$$: a new IIIV semiconductor for
photovoltaics. Using machine learning ML approach, we unearthed a new IIIV
semiconducting material having an optimal bandgap for high efficient
photovoltaics with the chemical composition of Gallium-Boron-PhosphideGaBP$_2$,
space group: Pna2$_1$. ML predictions are further validated by state of the art
ab-initio density functional theory DFT simulations. The stoichiometric Heyd-
Scuseria-Ernzerhof HSE bandgap of GaBP$_2$ is noted to 1.65 eV, a close ideal
value 1.4-1.5 eV to reach the theoretical Queisser-Shockley limit. The
calculated electron mobility is similar to that of silicon. Unlike perovskites,
the newly discovered material is thermally, dynamically and mechanically stable.
Above all the chemical composition of GaBP$_2$ are non-toxic and relatively
earth-abundant, making it a new generation of PV material. Using ML, we show
that with a minimal set of features the bandgap of IIIIIIV and IIIVV
semiconductor can be predicted up to an RMSE of less than 0.4 eV. We presented a
set of scaling laws, which can be used to estimate the bandgap of new IIIIIIV
and IIIVV semiconductor, with three different crystal phases, within an RMSE of
approx. 0.5 eV.

Deformation behavior of open-cell stainless steel foams. This study presents the
deformation and cell collapse behavior of open-cell stainless steel foams. 316L
stainless-steel open-cell foams with two porosities 30 and 45 pores per inch,
ppi were produced with the pressureless powder metallurgical method, and tested
in quasi-static compression.a result of the manufacturing technique, 316L
stainless steel open-cell foams have a high amount of microporosity. The
deformation behavior was investigated on a macroscopic scale by digital image
correlation DIC evaluation of light micrographs and on the microscopic scale by
in situ loading of cells in the scanning electron microscope. The deformation
behavior of the metal foams was highly affected by microstructural features,
such as closed pores and their distribution throughout the foam specimen.
Moreover, the closed pores made a contribution to the plateau stress of the
foams through cell face stretching. Strut buckling and bending are the dominant
mechanisms in cell collapse. Although there are edge defects on the struts, the
struts have an enormous plastic deformation capability. The cell size of the
steel foams had no significant effect on the mechanical properties. Due to the
inhomogeneities in the microstructure, the measured plateau stresses of the
foams showed about 20% scatter at the same relative density.

Improvement of fatigue properties in type 304 stainless steel by annealing
treatment in nitrogen gas. The effects of annealing in nitrogen gas on the
fatigue and static mechanical properties were studied using type 304 austenitic
stainless steel. Annealing in nitrogen gas was performed at and at for 30h,
resulting in the precipitation of nitrides at grain boundaries and inside grains
at both temperatures. The nitrides were identified as a chromium nitride by EDX
analysis. There were fewer nitrides present in specimens treated at than at. The
higher solubility of nitrogen at lowered the amount of chromium nitride. The
hardness and tensile tests revealed that the surface hardness and the static
strength were significantly improved by annealing in nitrogen gas. The fatigue
strengths of the annealed specimens significantly increased compared with that
of the untreated specimen, and the specimen annealed at obtained a higher
fatigue strength than that of the specimen annealed at. After fatigue tests at
fatigue limit stress levels, a strain-induced martensitic transformation was
observed in the untreated specimen because the austenite phase of type 304 steel
is metastable. However, in the annealed specimens, the strain-induced
martensitic transformation did not occur during fatigue tests at fatigue limit
stress levels, indicating that was stabilized by nitrogen in the solid solution.

With increasing sintering temperature, the grain size increases, the ceramics
form more close porosity, the bulk density and linear shrinkage increase, the
apparent porosity decreases, the microhardness decreases significantly, the
bending strength and compressive strength are improved obviously with the

AA-5083-O sheets processed by the Friction Stir Processing FSP. The FSP process
was studied and a FSP tool was built. Processing quality was verified by the
metallography in the processing region, which established the voids presence.
Tensile tests were carried out on FSP and non-FSP specimens, and the results
showed that FSP specimens have 30% greater resistance than non-FSP ones. The
formability of FSP sheets was produced in MSC-MARC and Abaqus and these software
products were compared by using the nonlinear FEM code. The Forming Limit
Diagram was built with the results from both software products. A device to
process FSP sheet metals was developed and the sheets were processed to validate
the results from the software. The tools made for the bulge tests were circular

approximation to those obtained from the software. The FSP sheets broke when
inferior pressure was applied because of the defects in the FSP process. The
results of the FSP presented the same formability of commercial sheets, however,

Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Field Influencing Horizontal Direct Chill Casting
of Aluminum Alloy Rods. The horizontal direct chill HDC casting process is a
well-established production route for an aluminum alloy ingot; however, the
ingot may suffer from inhomogeneous microstructures and serious macrosegregation
due to the unbalanced cooling condition and gravitational effect. In order to
control the defect, a low frequency electromagnetic field has been applied in
the HDC casting process and its influences on microstructures and
macrosegregation have been studied. The results show that the low frequency
electromagnetic field can improve macrostructures, reduce inhomogeneous
microstructures and macrosegregation in HDC product; and two main parameters of
the electromagnetic fielddensity and frequency influence the microstructures and
solution distribution along the diameter of the ingot significantly. In the
range of ampere-turns and frequency employed in the experiments, the optimum

Modeling the effect of laser heating on the strength and failure of 7075-T6
aluminum. The effect of rapid laser heating on the response of 7075-T6 aluminum
has been characterized using 3-D digital image correlation and a series of
thermocouples. The experimental results indicate that as the samples are held
under a constant load, the heating from the laser profile causes non-uniform
temperature and strain fields, and the strain-rate increases dramatically as the
sample nears failure. Simulations have been conducted using the LLNL multi-
physics code ALE3D, and compared to the experiments. The strength and failure of
the material was modeled using the JohnsonCook strength and damage models. In
order to capture the response, a dual-condition criterion was utilized which
calibrated one set of parameters to low temperature quasi-static strain rate
data, while the other parameter set is calibrated to high temperature high
strain rate data. The thermal effects were captured using temperature dependent
thermal constants and invoking thermal transport with conduction, convection,
and thermal radiation.

Constitutive description of plain carbon steels deformed at high temperatures:

carbon content, deformed in the temperature range of, in a wide spectrum of
strain rates. The main objective of the work has been the interpretation of the
weakening effect of the addition of carbon to the steel when it is deformed
under such conditions. The MTS, as a structural parameter, has been assumed to
be composed of two distinct components: one that arises as a result of the
interaction of dislocations with solute carbon atoms and another that results as
a consequence of the interaction of dislocation among themselves and the re-
arrangement of the dislocation substructure by means of dynamic recovery. The
results of the present investigation indicate that the weakening influence of
the carbon addition is a result of the decrease of both components with the

Achievement of high yield strength and strain hardening rate by forming fine

steels containing a considerable content of Al show high specific strength and

yield-to-tensile ratio, and high strain hardening is attributed to Lomer-
Cottrell lock and planar slip, and cell structure by further deformation in

Alloying element additions to Ni3Al: Site preferences and effects on elastic
properties from first-principles calculations. First-principles calculations
were performed to study the effects of alloying elements Mo, Re, Ta, W, Ti, Co,
Nb, Ru, Cr, Y on the elastic properties of Ni3Al. The site preferences of the
alloying elements in Ni3Al at different temperature and concentrations were
predicted. The influence of alloying elements on the lattice parameters of Ni3Al
were calculated and compared with the values fitted from experimental data. The
effects of alloying elements on the elastic constants of Ni3Al were present. The
directional shear and Youngs moduli for single-crystal Ni3Al alloys with
alloying elements were estimated. The bulk, shear, and Youngs moduli of
polycrystalline alloys were obtained. It is found that all the alloying elements
occupy Al sites except Ru and Co, which may occupy both sites depending on
concentration and temperature. All the elements increase shear and Youngs moduli
of single-crystal Ni3Al in all orientations except Cr, Co and Y. All the
elements increase both bulk and shear moduli of polycrystalline Ni3Al except Co
and Y. The solute atoms with higher bulk modulus tend higher bulk modulus of
Ni3Al alloys, and the bulk modulus is related to the mole volume either.

Electroless silver plating activated with thermo-alkaline solution on fly ash
cenosphere surface. Electroless silver planting on the surface of fly ash
cenospheres using formaldehyde as reducing reagent was prepared by adopting a
buffer solution of HF and NaF to rouging treatments and then thermo-alkaline
treatment at 80 for instead of palladium activating treatment. The morphologies
of the prepared composite particles were studied with SEM and their chemical
composition were confirmed by EDS and XRD. The results revealed that,the
coatings of fly ash cenosphere particles are uniform and dense,which is due to
the silver nucleation effect improving by surface roughness. Surface roughing
treatments could increase surface roughness of the cenosphere particles. With
the pH value of plating solution improving,the coatings become more and more
uniform and dense,moreover the silver layer is obviously thickened. The uniform
and dense silver coating for the silver-coated fly ash cenospheres composite

Applications of in situ reactions to MoSi2-based materials. The influence of
silica in MoSi2 -based materials is briefly reviewed and it is shown that these
materials would benefit from the elimination of this oxide. In situ displacement
reactions in which aluminum is used to convert silica to alumina are shown to be
a viable processing route for that purpose. It is shown how, with the adequate
selection of precursors, this technique can be extended to generate in situ
coatings on refractory metal reinforcements, preventing their interaction with
MoSi2 as well as in situ alumina fibrous reinforcements using silica-rich fiber
precursors. Furthermore, in situ displacement reactions are used to generate
boride reinforcements in MoSi2 and aluminum additions can also be used to
eliminate silica in these composites. Since the critical aspects for the design
of in situ processes are the knowledge of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the
possible reactions, the thermodynamics of the most relevant in situ processes
described are analyzed using the data currently available. This analysis is
limited by the extent of the data available but is helpful in guiding new
process development.

An Energy Approach Applied to Define Elasto-Plastic Constitutive Models
Describing Thermomechanical Metallic Materials Behavior During Forming
Processes. A new formalism for the definition of metallic materials constitutive
laws expressing the stress as a function of the plastic deformation energy it is
proposed. This new approach, called energy approach, can integrate physical
mechanisms governing the microstructure changes during a plastic deformation. It
is also important to emphasize that the proposed energy formulation is more
relevant since it can describe physical phenomena taking place in a material
forming process characterizing at the different scales the material properties
evolution. This formulation remains valid for a large field of deformation, the
whole spectrum of loading conditions and remains able to predict rigorously the
material response for all types of stresses states: static, transient or
dynamic.

Study on the Effect of Bleaching Treatment on the Mechanical Properties of Kenaf
Fibers. Automotive industries are trying to reduce the weight of cars by
replacing parts that are made of steel and aluminum with lighter material but
equally strong. It is an emerging trend in these industries to utilize
polypropylene reinforced with natural fiber as the alternative lightweight
material. PP-natural fiber composite is projected to have market growth with
compound annual growth rate CAGR of 9.5% within 2018-2025. Blending PP with
natural fiber is a challenging process considering these two materials are not
compatible enough to produce composite with desired mechanical properties. Prior
treatment to the fiber is required to improve its compatibility with PP with
cautionary that it does not degrading the mechanical strength of the fiber. The
aim of this work was to study the effect of chemical treatment on Kenaf fiber to
the tensile strength of the fiber. Kenaf fiber was bleached with NaClO solution
at various concentration 1-10% v/w, temperature 25-55C, and duration 1-6 hours.
The effect of bleaching treatment to the chemical structure and the tensile
strength of the fiber was analyzed using FTIR and UTM respectively. This study
showed that the fiber with highest tensile strength was the one that treated
with NaClO solution with concentration 1% v/w, at for 1 hour. This treatment
removed impurities for the surface and reduced some amorphous part of the fiber.
However further increasing NaClO concentration, mixing temperature and duration
will damage the cellulose chain in Kenaf fiber which will decrease the
mechanical strength of the fiber.

synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method using a surfactant CTAB and a
precipitation agent urea. The samples were characterized by XRD, SEM and BET
methods. The electrochemical properties of the samples as anode materials for
lithium batteries were studied by EIS and Galvanostatic measurements. The Co3O4
/MWCNTs composites displayed higher capacity and better cycle performance in
comparison with the Co3O4 nanosheets. The remarkable improvement of
electrochemical performance within the hybrid composites is probably related to
the addition ofthat possesses improved properties such as excellent electric
conductivity and large surface area, which helps to alleviate the effect of

Effect of Surface Microstructures on Hydrophobicity and Barrier Property of
Anticorrosive Coatings Prepared by Soft Lithography. Enhancing the
hydrophobicity of organic coatings retards their interaction with water and
often leads to better protectiveness over metal corrosion. In this study, a soft
lithography method was used to prepare epoxy coatings which showed surface
microstructures in high replication to sandpapers. The effect of microstructures
on coatings hydrophobicity and barrier property was investigated. Compared to
flat coatings, the microstructured coatings showed much higher water contact
angles, which further increased with finer sandpapers. Determined by
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS, the flat coating exhibited a higher
anticorrosive performance than the microstructured coatings. With the use of
finer sandpaper, the groove size of the corresponding microstructured coating
was reduced. And a lower anticorrosive performance was observed since more
defects might be formed in a given area of coating during the imprinting
process.the groove size of the coatings was further decreased to 5.7 m, the
microstructures became too small for water to easily penetrate through.
Therefore, trapped air acted as an additional barrier and contributed to an
increased anticorrosive performance compared to other microstructured coatings.

Modelling high strain rate phenomena in metal cutting simulation. Chip formation
in metal cutting is associated with large strains and high strain rates,
concentrated locally to deformation zones in front of the tool and beneath the
cutting edge. Furthermore, dissipative plastic work and friction work generate
high local temperatures. These phenomena together with numerical complications
make modelling of metal cutting difficult. Material models, which are crucial in
metal cutting simulations, are usually calibrated based on data from material
testing. Nevertheless, the magnitude of strains and strain rates involved in
metal cutting are several orders higher than those generated from conventional
material testing. A highly desirable feature is therefore a material model that
can be extrapolated outside the calibration range. In this study, two variants
of a flow stress model based on dislocation density and vacancy concentration
are used to simulate orthogonal metal cutting of AISI 316L stainless steel. It
is found that the addition of phonon drag improves the results somewhat but the
addition of this phenomenon still does not make it possible to extrapolate the
constitutive model reliably outside its calibration range.

nanoparticles were used as the catalyst and were dispersed on the silicon wafer

electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The photoluminescence PL study
reveals that In2O3 nanoloquats could emit different luminescence peaks in the
range of 500600 nm with broad bands by adjusting different oxygen flow rates.
The coverage of the wavelength tuning in the emission peaks of the In2O3

agglomerated feedstock powder by plasma spray and cold spray. In the case of the
plasma spray, the external feedstock injection EFI and the internal feedstock
injection IFI were adopted to compare oxidation, microstructure, porosity, and
tungsten recovery in the deposits. The IFI deposit had less oxidation, denser
microstructure, and more tungsten retention compared to the EFI. Especially,
more tungsten particles were melted from the IFI than from the EFI at input
power of 25kW. Thermal expansion coefficient of plasma sprayed composite
72W/28Cu vol.% was approximately 5.2x10-6/K. In the cold spray, no oxidation and
more dense microstructures were observed with porosity of less than 1.0 vol.%.
However lots of tungsten was lost due to insufficient plastic deformation.

Trabecular Titanium TT has been developed. In this in vitro study, we tested the
genetic effects of TT on osteoblast-like cells MG63 using DNA microarrays
technology: cDNA microarrays provides the ability to comparatively analyze mRNA
expression of thousands of genes in parallel thus showing activated and
repressed genes by the presence of the TT. Several genes that were significantly
up- or downregulated have been identified. Globally, it was demonstrated that TT
stimulates osteoblasts proliferation and differentiation, and reduces apoptosis.
Therefore, all these effects can contribute to improve the osseointegration of
this material. These results encourage the clinical application of Trabecular
Titanium to prosthetic devices.

improving the bonding strength and microstructure of AT13. AT13 was air heat-
treated with varying holding times and cooling methods. The aims are not only to
ascertain the changes of the bonding strength and micro-structure of AT13 under
various conditions, but also to understand the influence of holding time and
cooling method on the bonding strength and microstructure of the coating. The
experimental results showed that the best bonding strength and lowest porosity
of AT13 were obtained using proper heat treatment of heating up to for 6 h along
with two-step cooling. The two-step cooling is better than normal furnace
cooling in improving properties of the coating, which is attributed to the
densification of AT13 and release of residual stress.

Effect of hot extrusion on the microstructure and mechanical properties of

deformation behaviour of SiCwSiCp/2024Al hybrid composites, 2024Al reinforced
with both whiskers and nano-particles of silicon carbide were fabricated by
squeeze casting, and hot extrusion was conducted subsequently. The mechanical
properties of the hybrid composites were measured before and after deformation.
Microstructure of the composites was observed by SEM and TEM. Microstructure
observation results show that the reinforcements distribute homogeneously in the
matrix of the as cast composites and they bond well. Hot extrusion leads to a
directional distribution of the SiC whiskers and a more homogenous spatial
distribution of the SiC nanoparticles in the composites. Tensile test indicates
that the strength of the composites increase with increasing content of the
nanoparticles and raise further after extrusion. Compared with the matrix, the

Results indicated that the lubricant oils adding oleic acid-modified zinc
phosphate nanoparticles exhibited a good friction-reduction and anti-wear

optimum concentration. Friction coefficient decreased 14.2% maximally, and the
wear-scar width reduced to 36.5% correspondingly, as compared to the base oil
without nanoparticles. The results of the worn surface analysis with SEM and AFM

X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. From these analyses, it was
found that silver ions were trapped in TiO2 matrix and their reduction could be
achieved at annealing temperature. The antibacterial activity against S. aureus

quantitave determination of silver ion concentration releasing from the AgTiO2
thin film. The releasing rate of silver ions from the AgTiO2 film was 0118 g/ml

Investigations on the fracture toughness of austempered ductile iron alloyed
with chromium. An investigation was carried out to examine the influence of
chromium content on the plane strain fracture toughness of austempered ductile
iron ADI.containing 0, 0.3 and 0.5 wt.% chromium were austempered over a range
of temperatures to produce different microstructures. The microstructures were
characterized by optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Plane strain fracture
toughness of all these materials was determined and correlated with
microstructure and chromium content. The chromium content was found to influence
the fracture toughness through its influence on the processing window. Since the
chromium addition shifts the processing window to shorter durations, the higher
chromium alloys at higher austempering temperatures tend to fall outside of the
processing window, resulting in less than optimum microstructure and inferior
fracture toughness. A small chromium addition of 0.3 wt.% was found to be
beneficial for the fracture toughness of ADI.

Creep properties and relevant deformation mechanisms of two low-cost nickel-
based single crystal superalloys at elevated temperatures. In this work, the
creep properties and relevant deformation mechanisms of the two self-designed
low-cost single crystal superalloys were studied under the conditions of/172 MPa
and/248 MPa. The experimental alloys both displayed superior creep properties
than the typical second-generation single crystal superalloy Ren N5. During high
temperature creep tests, the rafted phase became more and more twisted with the
decrease of distance away from the fracture surface, which was caused by the
existence of a stress gradient in the gauge length section of the fractured
specimen. Under high temperature and low stress conditions, the Re-free alloy
displayed denser dislocation networks under both test conditions. Based on the
nodal reaction theory, the dislocation networks with different shapes formed by
reactions of a/2<110> dislocations at the / interface. Furthermore, the
morphology of dislocation networks could transform from initial rectangles to
octagons and then to thick hexagons. Under the condition of/248 MPa, some
parallel dislocation arrays in particles caused by dislocations pile-up was
found in the Re-low alloy, and the main obstacles to the motion of dislocations
were KW locks and a<010> superdislocations. Based on the calculated critical
resolved shear stresses, the primary deformation mechanism of the two
experimental alloys under elevated temperature and low stress conditions was
identified as dislocations slipping in matrix and climbing over rafted phase.
The use of rare metal element Re in two self-designed nickel-based single
crystal superalloys was greatly reduced. The creep deformation mechanisms under
the conditions of high temperatures and low stresses were studied in detail. The
formation mechanisms of the interfacial dislocation networks were systematically
analyzed. A large number of parallel dislocation arrays were found in the phases
of the low rhenium alloy.

The quasi-static and dynamic response of fine-grained Mg alloy AMX602: An
experimental and computational study. A high strength magnesium alloy, AMX602
Mg-6%Al-0.5%Mn-2%Ca, was manufactured by the spinning water atomization process
SWAP and extruded into bar and plate geometries. Microstructural analysis using
electron backscatter diffraction revealed that the processing produces an alloy
with grains between 0.5 and 5m, with comparatively weak texture for Mg. The
plate and bar had different texturesthe former had a conventional hexagonal-
close-packed HCP rolling texture and the latter a HCP extrusion texture. Quasi-
static and dynamic compression experiments were performed to probe the
material's mechanical behavior in the three processing directions. The
experiments on each geometry revealed different anisotropic properties induced
by a change in the active deformation mechanisms. The anisotropy was more
pronounced at dynamic strain rates than quasi-static. A reduced-order crystal
plasticity model that demarcates twinning, basal slip, and non-basal slip
mechanisms was fit to the experimental data from the plate and bar. The model
was consistent with experimental data and revealed that in the plate twinning
dominated yielding in the extrusion and transverse directions, but slip
dominated the normal direction. Yielding in the bar was dominated by twinning in
the extrusion direction, but both slip and twinning were significant in the
other two directions. The model showed the different anisotropic responses were
due to the different textures produced during the processing of each geometry.
Lastly, our data provided the basis for considering twinning to be rate
insensitive in the model, which we confirm to be valid to at least 5000s 1 .

Effect of temperature and cyclic loading on stress relaxation behavior of
Ti6Al4V titanium alloy. The effect of temperature and cyclic loading on stress
relaxation SR behavior of Ti6Al4V titanium alloy was studied by uniaxial tensile
test. SR limit and rate vary with increasing the temperature and cyclic loading
times. The microstructural variations were observed by scanning and transmission
electron microscopes. Unstable SR behavior happens at, which becomes obvious
with the increase of cyclic loading times or the decrease of relaxation
temperature. The stress instability maybe attributes to the activation energy
improvement. Based on dislocation distribution and morphology as well as stress
exponent values varying from 1.8 to 2.4, SR mechanism of the alloy is
dislocation creep in the tested temperature range. The mechanical properties of
the alloy at room temperature almost maintains invariable after SR process.
However, the discontinuous yielding in as-received alloy changes to continuous
yielding in relaxed ones.

Auger electron spectroscopy of the high superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8:

Auger lines of all the elements. The main lines for the different elements are:

layers by Ar + ion bombardment, the intensity of the bismuth line is reduced
while the intensity of the calcium line is increased, indicating as expected
that the surface layer is a BiO layer. After a few minutes this new spectrum
spontaneously turns back into the first one, indicating the surface layer to be

The Influence of Curing Cycles on Properties of the Epoxy System 3221/RH Glass
Fabric Composite. In this investigation,the epoxy system 3221/RH glass fabric
laminates were cured in different cure cycles.The influence of the curing
processes on composites glass transition temperatureTg and relative stiffnessE
were investigated using dynamic mechanical analyzeDMA.The coupons were immersed
in the distilled water at different temperatures,then Tg,E were tested for the
immersed coupons.The results show that the coupons with higher crosslink density
achieve higher Tg,but exhibit a larger reduction in Tg after immersion in
comparison to those with lower crosslink density.Generally,Tg and E of all
coupons are reduced distinctly after immersion.For the coupons with the same
curing cycle,E is higher at 70 immersion than at 50 immersion.This arises from
further cure reaction in the epoxy system when the coupons underwent immersion
at 70 .

Calculation of the self - formation driving force for composite microstructure
in liquid immiscible alloy system. Using Becker's method, we calculate the
interfacial energy between two liquid phases in an immiscible system. Based on
the Gibbs-Thomson equation, the force acting on the droplet towards the thermal
center can be obtained by integrating the interfacial energy between the droplet
and matrix liquid phase, which is related to both the radius of a droplet and
the temperature gradient. In addition, the forces of gravitation and buoyancy
also act on the droplet. The calculated results indicate that the resultant for
these forces together mainly decides the microstructure morphology of the
solidified alloy. The calculated results are in good agreement with the
corresponding experimental results.

was the result of the first step of the simulation in ANSYS Polyflow - the
simulation of the product manufacturing by extrusion blow moulding. The
hydrostatic pressure factor was taken into account during the top load

High Temperature Deformation Behaviour of a Mg-0.8AlAlloy. There is considerable
interest currently in developing magnesium based alloys as replacements for
aluminum alloys in automobile applications, due to their high specific strength
as compared to aluminum alloys. However, the poor formability of magnesium
alloys has restricted their applications; superplasticity can be utilized to
form components with complex shapes. In the present study, the compressive
deformation characteristics of a Mg-0.8 wt% Al alloy with an initial grain size
of 19 +/- 1.0 mum have been studied in the temperature range ofK and at strain
rates ranging from 10-7 to 10-3 s-1. The stress exponent was observed to
decrease with a decrease in stress. The results are analyzed in terms of the
existing theoretical models for high temperature deformation. Furthermore, the
potential for superplasticity in this alloy is explored, based on the mechanical
and microstructural characteristics of the alloy.

Effect of Shot Peening on Delayed Fracture of High Strength Steel.. A study was
made on the effect of shot peening on delayed fracture of high strength steel at
a level of 1300MPa and 1400MPa. To investigate this effect, three types shots,
having different hardness and mean diameter, were prepared to make the different
residual stress distribution in the bending type specimen. Using these shots,
specimens were peeved by an air type shot peening device. It was confirmed that
the delayed fracture resistance of each shot peened specimen was improved
compared with those of as quenched and tempered specimens due to an increase in
compressive residual stress. By measuring the displacement of moment arm, it was
found that this result was caused mainly by a prolonged incubation period to
crack initiation, the reason of which would be that the compressive residual
stress defended hydrogen entry in metal.

Refractory self-reinforced Y--SiAlON with barium aluminosilicate glass ceramic
addition. Refractory Y--SiAlONs with elongated microstructure were obtained by
hot pressing and post-heat treatment using BaAl2Si2O8BAS as an additive. The
results showed that BAS not only served as a liquid phase sintering aid to
promote densification, but also facilitated the development of elongated -sialon
grains, resulting in excellent room and high-temperature mechanical properties.
Increasing the amount of BAS addition and post-heat treatment could further
effectively promote the anisotropic growth of -SiAlON grains, the room-
temperature flexural strength and fracture toughness of 10wt% BAS/Y--SiAlON
could reach 634MPa and 7.2MPam 1/2/ , respectively. The resultant materials

EIS Study on Pitting Corrosion of AA5083-H321Aluminum-Magnesium Alloy in
Stagnant 3.5% NaClSolution. In this research, EIS electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy technique was utilized to study the pitting corrosion behaviour of
AA5083-H321 aluminum-magnesium alloy in 3.5% NaCl solution. Impedance spectra
were obtained during 240 h of exposure of the sample to the test solution. The
surface and cross-section of the samples were studied by scanning electron
microscopy SEM and EDAX energy dispersive analysis of X-ray analysis. The
results indicated that as the resistance of the passive layer on intermetallic
particles is very small, this parameter on the sample surface layers is
controlled by that of pure passive layer. However, the capacitors in the
proposed equivalent circuit are replaced with the constant phase elements CPE,
due to non-uniformity and occurrence of pitting corrosion on the surface. The
outward diusion of Al +3 ions through the passive layer and the thickening of
this layer cause the impedance decrease in the first 24 h and increase
afterwards. The detachment of intermetallic particles from some of pits and the
accumulation of the corrosion products inside some others are factors that
prevents the continuation of cathodic reactions on the top of the intermetallic
particles.

Application of the cyclic phase transformation concept for determining the
effective austenite/ferrite interface mobility. A series of cyclic partial
austeniteferrite phase transformation computer simulation experiments have been
performed to elucidate the rate controlling dissipative processes during
austenite-to-ferrite and the ferrite-to-austenite transformation in lean CMn
steels. The transformation kinetics is analyzed by comparing the results of two
complementary sharp interface models one is based on the assumption of local
equilibrium at the migrating interface in the other model diffusion in the
interface and the interfacial reaction is implemented by an effective interface
mobility but substitutional diffusion in the bulk phases is neglected. Values
for effective interface mobilities have been obtained for both the austenite-to-
ferrite transformation and vice versa. By means of effective mobilities which
depend only on initial composition and temperature, the transformation kinetics
has been studied for other heat treatments than used to determine the effective
interfacial mobility values. Although substitutional diffusion in the bulk is
not taken into account, for the low Mn alloys it is possible to obtain similar
trends by the effective mobility model as provided by the local equilibrium
model. At modest to high interface velocities long range diffusion of the
substitutional alloying elements can be ignored but then the effects of local
diffusion processes near the interface need to be taken into account via an
effective interface mobility. The effective mobility for the austenite-to-
ferrite transformation differs from the effective mobility during the ferrite-
to-austenite transformation in a rather essential manner.

Results on centrifugally spun composite-fiber anodes for&are reported.
Procedures employed to produce beneficial fiber morphologies in CF are

given. Nanofibersand compositehave been widely used as electrode and separator
materials in lithium-ion batteriesand sodium-ion batteriesdue to their high
surface-area-to-volume ratio and versatility of their morphologies. The majority

thermal treatment. Nevertheless, the low fiber yield and safety hazards
associated with this method have raised concerns and limited the
commercialization of composite CF anodes. Fiber and nanofiber processing methods
such as centrifugal spinning can overcome low productivity and eliminate the use
of a high voltage to produce fibers. In the present work, centrifugally spun

Electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements to estimate the uniaxial
compressive strength of a fault breccia. Fault breccias are usually not suitable
for preparing smooth specimens or else the preparation of such specimens is
tedious, time consuming and expensive. To develop a predictive model for the
uniaxial compressive strength UCS of a fault breccia from electrical resistivity
values obtained from the electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements, twenty-
four samples of a fault breccia were tested in the laboratory. The UCS values
were correlated with corresponding resistivity values and a strong correlation
between them could not be found. However, a strong correlation was found for the
samples having volumetric block proportion VBP of 2575%. In addition, it was
seen that VBP strongly correlated with resistivity. It was concluded that the
UCS of the tested breccia can be estimated from resistivity for the samples
having VBP of 2575%.

Experimental Investigation for Modeling of Elastic-Plastic-Damage Materials
Investigation of Damage Surface under Multiaxial Loading.. Applicability and
fundamental aspects of the irreversible thermodynamics theory of elastic-
plastic-damaging materials are discussed by performing a series of multiaxial
damage tests. The changes of Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and shear modulus
under tension and torsion are first observed for thin tubular specimens of
spheroidized graphite cast iron. The Acoustic Emission AE count rate is also
measured in order to detect the onset and the development of material damage.
The changes in the elastic properties are related to the AE count rate. Then, by
performing damage tests under proportional and nonproportional loading, the
initial and subsequent damage surfaces are identified by use of AE count rate.
The conditions of loading, unloading and neutral loading for the damage surface
are established by the experiments. The influence of the hydrostatic stress on
the initial damage surface is found larger than that of subsequent surfaces.

gravimetric analysis TGA, the pyrolyses of rayon have been studied respectively
by using impregnants phosphoric acid PA,its three ammonium salts and ammonium
sulfate AS. The air is favorable for the pyrolysis of rayon treated by dibasic
ammonium phosphate DAP, but useless for those of the other impregnants. It is
put forward that the ratio of height to half-height-width H/W1 /2 of a peak on a
differential thermal gravimetric DTG curve could be used to describe the peak's
shape character. The smaller the ratio is,e. the more flatten the peak is , the
more moderately the thermal decomposition reaction carries out , which would
lead to higher carbonization and activation yields of rayon. The experimental
results prove this point of view. According to expectation, DAP's function is
the best, ammonium dihydric phosphate's ADP is equal to PA's, ammonium
phosphate'sAPis worse;AS has lower specific surface area, and no-impregnant
gives the lowest yield and specific surface area.

Mechanical response of two polyimides through coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics MD simulations allow us to
predict the mechanical responses of polymers, starting merely with a description
of their molecular architectures. It is interesting to ask whether, given two
competing molecular architectures, coarse-grained MD simulations can predict the
differences that can be expected in their mechanical responses. We have studied
two crosslinked polyimides PMR15 and HFPE52both used in high- temperature
applicationsto assess whether the subtle differences in their uniaxial
stressstrain responses, revealed by experiments, can be reproduced by carefully
coarse-grained MD models. The coarse graining procedure for PMR15 is outlined in
this work, while the coarse grain forcefields for HFPE52 are borrowed from an
earlier one Pandiyan et al 2015 Macromol. Theory Simul. 24 51320. We show that
the stressstrain responses of both these polyimides are qualitatively
reproduced, and important insights into their deformation and failure mechanisms
are obtained. More importantly, the differences in the molecular architecture
between the polyimides carry over to the differences in the stressstrain
responses in a manner that parallels the experimental results. A critical
assessment of the successes and shortcomings of predicting mechanical responses
through coarse-grained MD simulations has been made.

Cohesive zone representation of crack and void growth in single crystal nickel
via molecular dynamics simulation. Pre-existing center crack and void growth in
single crystal nickel under Mode I loading are investigated by introducing a
cohesive zone model CZM based on molecular dynamics MD simulation. The
microstructural evolution and stress distribution during crack and void growth
are analyzed as are the associated mechanical properties. The results indicate
that the crack and void have different fracture mechanisms. Crack-tip blunting
occurs due to the 110 super-dislocations emission during crack growth, while for
void growth the primary micro-mechanism is the formation of stacking faults,
which result in the different growth rates, opening displacements, and stress
states. Based on the calculation of the CZM, the crack has a greater growth
speed and opening displacement, but a lower tensile stress and fracture strain
than the void under the same loading conditions, and the high stress is
accompanied by microstructural evolution during crack and void growth.

Heat treatment of UDIMET 720Li: the effect of microstructure on properties. The

placed on the characterisation of precipitation kinetics using optical and

observations are interpreted using thermodynamic, phase transformation and
precipitate hardening theories. The results have implications for the gas

microstructure during ageing, a heat treatment of 24 h at is proposed, which is
believed to be optimal. This allows full advantage to be taken of the properties
of the alloy, whilst reducing the costs and time associated with the heat

Shell DFT-1/2/ method towards engineering accuracy for semiconductors: GGA
versus LDA. The Kohn-Sham gaps of density functional theory DFT obtained in
terms of local density approximation LDA or generalized gradient approximation
GGA cannot be directly linked to the fundamental gaps of semiconductors, but in
engineering there is a strong demand to match them through certain rectification
methods. Shell DFT-1/2/ shDFT-1/2/, as a variant of DFT-1/2/, is a potential
candidate to yield much improved band gaps for covalent semiconductors, but its
accuracy depends on the LDA/GGA ground state, including optimized lattice
parameters, basic Kohn-Sham gap before self-energy correction and the amount of
self-energy correction that is specific to the exchange-correlation XC
functional. In this work, the LDA/GGA as well as shDFT-1/2/ results of six
technically important covalent semiconductors Si, Ge, GaN, GaP, GaAs and GaSb
were tested, with an additional ionic insulator LiF for comparison. The impact
of XC flavor LDA, PBEsol, PBE and RPBE, either directly on the gap value, or
indirectly through the optimized lattice constant, is examined comprehensively.
Moreover, the impact of XC flavor on LDA/GGA and shDFT-1/2/ gaps was
investigated under the condition of fixed experimental lattice constants. In-

Electrochemical approaches for rearrangement of lead sulfide thin films prepared
by SILAR method. Potentiostatic and potentiodynamic approaches have been
performed for rearrangement of lead sulfide thin films prepared by a successive
ionic layer adsorption and desorption technique on Au electrodes. Potentiostatic
processes have been applied by potential-controlled electrolyses at 450mV and
potentiodynamic applications have been performed by cyclic voltammetry scanning
potential between 800 and 50mV on lead sulfide modified Au electrodes in pH 5.9
solution. These potential values have been determined by considering
underpotential deposition of both lead and sulfur as a result of cyclic
voltammetry experiments of lead sulfide modified Au working electrodes. Scanning
electron microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction
results show that electrochemical approaches cause a transformation from
amorphous to polycrystalline structure for PbS thin films. UVvisiblenear
infrared spectroscopy investigation of the samples reveals that the optical
properties of lead sulfide thin films are protected after electrochemical
processes.

Thermal Cycling of Copper Based Composite Reinforced with High Modulus Carbon
Fibres. The thermal expansion behaviour of Cu-1Cr/C composite subjected to 5
thermal cycles in the temperature range 30 - was investigated. The coefficients
of thermal expansionsas low as 0.7 x 10 -6 K -1 in longitudinal and as large as
24.0 x 10 -6 K -1 in transversal direction were obtained. Electron microscopy
observations confirmed the high structural stability of the thermally cycled

Minicrystallization in directionally solidified multicrystalline silicon and its
effect on the photovoltaic properties of solar cells. In this paper, we report
the occurrence of minicrystallization in multicrystalline silicon ingots grown
by the directional solidification method and its effect on the photovoltaic PV
properties of multicrystalline silicon solar cells. Minicrystallization in
multicrystalline silicon ingots sometimes occurs when the directional
solidification process is not properly optimized, and it causes much smaller
grain sizes in the minicrystallized regions. Serious shunting behaviour has been
observed in multicrystalline silicon solar cells containing minicrystallized
regions, and it is highly localized to these minicrystallized regions.
Minicrystallization in multicrystalline silicon considerably deteriorates the
overall PV properties of solar cells.

Polaron dynamics in thin polythiophene films studied with time-resolved
photoemission. Femtosecond time-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy
is employed to study the dynamics of an excited state in a thin regioregular
poly3-hexylthiophene RR-P3HT film deposited on a conducting polymer
poly3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene: poly-styrenesulfonate PEDT:PSS electrode
following optical excitation at 2.1 eV. We found that the biexponential decay of
this excited state has a fast component 2.6 ps assigned to bound polaron pairs
which recombine quickly or separate to be added to the slow component 7.6 ps.
The latter is attributed to polarons generated via charge transfer between
adjacent polymer chains.

Simulation approach of atomic layer deposition in large 3D structures. We
present a new simulation method predicting thicknesses of thin films obtained by
atomic layer deposition in high aspect ratio 3D geometries as they appear in
MEMS manufacturing. The method features a Monte-Carlo computation of film
deposition in free molecular flow, as well as in the Knudsen and diffusive gas
regime, applicable for large structures. We compare our approach to analytic and
simulation results from the literature. The capability of the method is
demonstrated by a comparison to experimental film thicknesses in a large 3D

Preparation of Porous Titanium Dental Implant by 3D Printing/Composite Coating
and Its Biomechanical Properties and Flexural Strength. Dental implants have
been widely used in clinical practice. The 3D modeling software was used to
design threedimensional 3D models in the shapes of long strips, discs, and
screws,e., the Ti2.6Al1.2V0.42 specimens. Meanwhile, the implant material was
electrochemically precipitated, and a layer of chitosan nano-coating was added
to the surface. To test the bone-binding ability and planting success rate of
the material, the mechanical properties of the specimens with different porosity
0%70% were firstly analyzed by the three-point bending method. Then, the screw-
shaped titanium alloy specimens were divided into the solid group, the solid
coating group, the solid 30% group, the coating 30% group, the solid 50% group,
and the coating 50% group. The MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured, and the in vitro
biological properties of the specimens were tested from different angles. The
biomechanical properties and flexural strength of screw-shaped titanium alloy
specimens in different groups were tested by using a universal testing machine.
In the experiment, the prepared dental implants had the complete surface,
uniform pore distribution, dense coating distribution, and less overall cracks.
The elastic gradient of porous titanium specimens would decrease due to the
increase of porosity. The cell activity of the test specimen was higher, and the
percentage of viable cells exceeded 80%. The MTT test confirmed that the pores
of the test specimen could promote the increase of MTT value P &lt; 0.05, and
the test specimen/composite coating had higher ALP levels compared with the test
pieces with no surface treatments P &lt; 0.05. In biomechanical properties and
flexural strength tests, the increase of pores increased the biomechanical
properties P &lt; 0.05 and decreased the flexural resistance P &lt; 0.05, while
the increase of coating decreased the biomechanical properties and increased the
flexural resistance P &lt; 0.05. The porous titanium alloy specimens were
successfully prepared, and the chitosan-based composite coating was applied. The
material was non-toxic, which was beneficial to cell proliferation and had good
mechanical properties, thereby contributing to the growth of new bone.

Improved performance of organic solar cells by growth optimization of MoO3/CuI
double-anode buffer. We investigated the effect of a CuI anode buffer layer ABL
on the molecular orientation of the copper phthalocyanine CuPc in organic
photovoltaic cells OPV cells, and we compare it to the effect of MoO3 buffer
layer. While, in the presence of CuI, the CuPc molecules lie down parallel to
the substrate, they stand up perpendicular in the case of MoO3. We show that the
optical absorption, the morphology, and the J-V characteristics of the OPV cells
depends strongly on the orientation of the CuPc molecules. The improvement of
the OPV cells performance is related to the property modifications induced by
the change in molecule orientation. We show that the improvement of the OPV cell
performance through the templating effect of CuI depends strongly on the
deposition rate of the CuI, because the CuI thin-film morphology depends on this
deposition rate. In this context, we show that the use of a double-ABL MoO3/CuI
leads to a significant improvement of the cell performance. These results are
discussed on the basis of the dual function of MoO3 and CuI. While both of them
reduce the hole-injection barrier, CuI improves the CuPc film absorbance through
specific molecular order and MoO3 prevents the OPV cells from leakage-path
formation.

A hybrid method for computing forces on curved dislocations intersecting free
surfaces in three-dimensional dislocation dynamics. Dislocations intersecting
free surfaces present a challenge for numerical implementation of traction-free
boundary conditions in dislocation dynamics simulations. The difficulty arises
when singular analytic expressions of dislocation stress fields need to be used
in combination with numerical methods to calculate image stress fields due to
the free surfaces. A new hybrid method is developed here in which the singular
and non-singular parts of the image stress are dealt with separately. The
analytic solution for a semi-infinite straight dislocation intersecting the
surface of elastic half-space is used to account for the singular part of the
image stress, while the remaining non-singular part is treated using the
standard finite element method. The numerical advantages of this decomposition
are demonstrated with examples.

Tailoring depolarization temperature by phase transition causing properties
evolution in Bi0.5Na1K0.5TiO3 ceramics. K/Na ratio can regulate t d from to of
Bi0.5Na1 - x K x 0.5 TiO3 ceramics. T d defers with the increase of the ratio of
P4 mm/P4 bm , and the structural transition from short-range-correlated P4 bm to
long-range-correlated P4 mm should be the driving force for the growth of
poling-induced domain size. A small amount of k doping destabilizes
ferroelectric long-range order, while with an increment of k substitution,
ferroelectric long-range order becomes stabilized. Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 -based
materials have attracted widespread attention due to large electro-strain, large
remnant polarization P r and high Curie temperature T C , but the existence of
inherent depolarization temperature T d limits the temperature stability and
application temperature range. In this work, we find that K/Na ratio can
regulate T d from to of the ceramics, which confirms that the increase of K
substitution can effectively improve the temperature stability of the material.
The phase structure and electrical properties of Bi0.5Na1 - x K x 0.5 TiO3BNKT x
ceramics can be well modulated by changing K/Na. In addition, BNKT x system
exhibits excellent piezoelectric response at morphotropic phase boundary MPB of
20% BKT content d 33 =180 pC/N, where rhombohedral R 3 c phase and tetragonal P4
bm phase coexist in MPB. With K further substitution, BNKT x ceramics transform
into tetragonal phase, and the domain size grows due to the structural
transition from short-range-correlated P4 bm to long-range-correlated P4 mm .
The deferment of T d is also tightly related to the increase of P4 mm/P4 bm
ratio. This work can provide an effective way to tailor depolarization
temperature and electrical properties of BNT-based ceramics.

these junctions are greater than unity and barrier height varies from 0.60.7 eV
and are affected by room illumination. Photovoltaic effect of these junctions
was very poor and fill factor below 0.4. Low doping concentration, high defect
density, presence of an interfacial layer and presence of high series resistance
are perceived to affect theJV characteristic.

Fatigue behavior of Nitinol medical devices under multi-axial non-proportional
loads. Nickel-Titanium alloys Nitinol are widely used for biomedical
applications. Peripheral stents are almost exclusively composed of Nitinol, as
its superelasticity is suited for minimally-invasive insertion and durable
effect. After crimping and deployment stents undergo cyclic multi-axial loads
imposed by vascular and lower-limb motion e.g. axial compression, bending, and
torsion. This complex mechanical environment could lead to metal fatigue and
device fracture, with possible severe consequences e.g. in-stent restenosis.
Standard regulations require experimental verification of stent fatigue
behaviour for preclinical assessment, but no exact indications are provided to
direct the load combination. Moreover, different fatigue criteria were developed
for common metals to predict fatigue endurance, but no criteria were
specifically defined for the unique thermo-mechanical properties of Nitinol.
This study investigated the role of cyclic multi-axial loading conditions on
different stent geometries, looking at how they affect the stress/strain
distribution along the device and how different criteria may affect the fatigue
prediction e.g. the standard Von Mises alternate approach and other critical
plane approaches. Then, a preliminary experimental fatigue campaign was
performed in agreement with the numerical simulations in order to compare the
numerical predictions with the experimental results. The result suggest that the
critical plane approaches are more reliable than the standard Von Mises
criterion.

EPR study of the structural phase transitions in Fe3+doped TlInS2. The results
of low temperature EPR investigations of Fe doped TlInS2 single crystals in the
temperature range are presented. The EPR signal due to Fe3+ centers located at
the centers of InS4 tetrahedrons has been observed. It has been established that
the resonance lines exhibit a slight shift and remarkable splitting at the
temperatures lower than, which is attributed to the effect of the ferroelectric
phase transition. The rotational patterns of the resonance fields reveal a
doubling of the number of centers at low temperatures. The preliminary
simulation indicates that the doubling is related to the rotation of the
principal axis system of the centers, while the magnitude of fine structure
splitting is nearly the same. 2006 WILEY-VCHVerlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

Role of the advanced microstructures characterization in modeling of mechanical
properties of AHSS steels. Detailed knowledge of the fraction, morphology and
chemical composition of phase constituents and their effect on the mechanical
properties play a crucial role in understanding of the mechanisms influencing
the properties of Advanced High Strength Steels AHSS. On the other hand, the
most important microstructural features of these steels are characterized by
different size, starting from the nano- and ending on the microscale. Therefore,
a detailed characterization of the AHSS microstructure must involve many methods
capable of tracing the microstructure at different scale levels. The paper
presents selected capabilities of advanced analytical techniques, in combination
with conventional light optical microscopy LOM, for quantitative
characterization of the microstructure developed in AHSS steels during
thermomechanical processing or continuous annealing. The material used for the
investigation comprised the samples of DP steel sheet produced at the industrial
scale. Special emphasis was focused on the capabilities of the Field Emission
Gun Scanning Electron Microscopy FEG SEM combined with EBSD of microstructural
characterization. The significance of accurate microstructure characterization
for the modeling of mechanical properties of AHSS steels was demonstrated for
the case of numerical calculation of the stressstrain curve in the standard
tensile test. The work results indicate that such an engineering approach is
useful for prediction of material properties.

Synthesis of Glycerol Carbonate from Biomass Glycerol: Focus on the Calcination
Temperature. We carried out a reaction in which glycerol carbonate was
synthesized by using glycerol and urea. The physical properties of the prepared
catalysts were investigated by BET surface area, X-ray diffraction, temperature
programmed desorption, and Field-emission scanning electron microcopy. In
addition, we confirmed the conversion of the glycerol and the yield of the
glycerol carbonate according to calcination temperature. From XRD results, the
crystalline of prepared ZnAl2O4 was slowly increased with an increasing of the
calcination temperature. When the calcination temperature of ZnAl2O4 was 500 ,
the conversion of the glycerol was 74.4% and the yield of the glycerol carbonate
was 73.3%. The conversion of the glycerol and the yield of the glycerol
carbonate can be obtained higher when acid/base ratio is approx. 1. From this
result, we may conclude that the acid &amp; base site density and ratio of
catalysts were very important parameters in the synthesis of glycerol carbonate
from urea and glycerol.

Two types of graphite were used in the synthesis of the compound natural and
synthetic. Two lines, one broad and one narrow, were observed at the same

polymerized and the sharp line is motionally narrowed and due to SbF6 ions. This

Controlling the properties of magnesiummanganese ferrites. The effect of
substitution of In3+, Al3+ and Cr3+ ions on the electrical and magnetic
properties of MgMn ferrites has been investigated. The substitution of In3+ ions
in place of Fe3+ ions, resulted in an increase of lattice parameter, owing to
the larger size of the substituted ions, whereas lattice parameter decreased on
substituting Al3+ and Cr3+ ions in place of the Fe3+ ions, owing to the smaller
sizes of these substituted ions. D.C. resistivity was found to increase with the
substitution of In3+, Al3+ or Cr3+ ions in the MgMn ferrite system. The
improvement in the d.c. resistivity has been observed at the expense of
deterioration in the magnetic properties of Al3+ and Cr3+ substituted MgMn
ferrites. A significant reduction in the value of initial permeability,
saturation magnetization and Curie temperature were observed with successive
increase of Al3+ and Cr3+ ions. The saturation magnetization and initial
permeability were found to increase with incorporation of In3+ ions. A marked
increase in the value of initial permeability was found for the
Mg0.9Mn0.1In0.5Fe1.5O4 ferrites. The Curie temperature was found to decrease
with an increase of In3+ ion concentration. These changes in the properties are
explained on the basis of a modified cation distribution and their magnetic
interactions and various models.

Effects of annealing temperature on the microstructure, textures and tensile
properties of cold-rolled Fe13Cr4Al alloys with different Nb contents. In this
study, four Fe13Cr4Al alloys with different Nb contents 01.5wt% were prepared by
using vacuum induction melting, forging, hot rolling, and cold rolling. The
effects of annealing temperature 600C1100C and the Nb contents on the
microstructure, textures as well as tensile properties were investigated. The
dispersion of fine Fe2Nb-type Laves phase particles was observed in the BCC
matrix and along grain boundaries. These particles effectively pinned
dislocations and boundaries, resulting in stabilizing the microstructure,
delaying the recrystallization temperatures and refining the recrystallized
grains. The Laves phase particles were also able to retard the nucleation and
growth of the fiber grains, therefore Nb-containing alloys had weak
recrystallized fibers, which was beneficial to improve the processing properties
of Fe13Cr4Al alloys.the annealing temperature increased, the strengths decreased
while the elongation increased. Because of the effects of solid solution
strengthening, precipitation strengthening and fine grain strengthening produced
by the addition of Nb element, the strength and hardness of the alloys increased
with the increase of Nb content. Comprehensively considering the microstructure
and mechanical properties, the suitable addition of Nb content was 1wt%, and the
optimum annealing treatment after cold-rolling with 50% thickness reduction was
at for 30min.

Fatigue Strength of Welded Ultra High Strength Steels Improved by High Frequency
Hammer Peening. Existing design recommendations for the influence of high
frequency hammer peening HFHP on the fatigue strength are limited to maximum
steel strengths of S960 and plate thicknesses of 5 mm and higher. The influence
of HFHP on the fatigue strength of welded ultra high strength steels with yield
strengths of 960 N/mm 2 and higher - loaded in low cycle fatigue LCF
respectively upper finite fatigue life region - has not been investigated
sufficiently so far. For this reason, the Institute for Metal and Lightweight
Structures of the University of Duisburg-Essen has performed fatigue tests on
four different welded detailsbutt weld,transversal stiffener,longitudinal
stiffener andcover plates made of ultra high strength steels S960, S1100 and
S1300 to determine the influence of HFHP on the fatigue strength. The fatigue
strength of HFHP treated specimens was at least twice the fatigue strength of
the as welded toe condition. In comparison with existing investigations for
steel strengths S960 and lower, the results of the fatigue tests at HFHP-treated
specimens showed the same trend: the slope of the SN-curve increases to
approximately m = 5. Furthermore, after HFHP treatment in some cases the
location of crack initiation changes from the weld toe to the weld root or to
notches in the base material.

Corrosion behaviour of AZ80 Mg/berylliumbronzealloy galvanic couples in typical
marine environment. A high-strength AZ80 Mg alloy was prepared via multi-
direction forge, thermal extrusion and peak-aged heat treatment. The corrosion
behaviour of AZ80 Mg/berylliumbronzealloy galvanic couples in a typical marine
environment was investigated. Berylliumbronze alloy QBe1.7 Cu acted as cathode,
accelerating the corrosion of AZ80 Mg alloy. With the increase in contact areas,
the corrosion rates and galvanic effect also increased, and the galvanic
potentials moved positively. However, with a prolonged exposure time, the
galvanic potentials and current densities decreased. The corrosion products
mainly consisted of MgCl2, Mg5CO34OH25H2O and MgSO47H2O. According to the
standard of galvanic corrosion sensitivity from the Air Force Materials
Laboratory AFML, AZ80 Mg alloy was not allowed to make contact with QBe1.7 Cu
alloy without effective protection.

New Type Aluminum Alloys with Higher Strength. Nanocrystalline At-alloys
obtained by elevated temperature consolidation of rapidly quench-solidified Al-
RE and Al-RE-TMRE: Rare Earth, TM: Transition Metal show superior mechanical
properties in comparison to conventional At alloys. Rapid solidification by
either single roller or gas-atomization promotes the growth of a non-equilibrium
amorphous phase, which crystallizes into 100nm to 200nm matrix grains upon hot
extrusion. Apart from grain-refinement, this thermal consolidation process also
leads to the formation of nano-sized intermetallic compound precipitations. The
tensile strength of these precipitaion-strengthened nano-crystalline At alloys
is 900MPa, twice of that for conventional high performance Al-alloys.
Furthermore, super-plastic behavior with elongations above 600% and strain rates
exceeding 1/sec both at is observed. Low specific weight, high strength, high
thermal stability and stiffness E=90GPa makes this nanocrystalline At-alloy
suitable to a range of high-performance applications.

Temperature effect on structural and optical properties of V2O5 thin films
prepared by spray pyrolysis technique. In this work, the effect of substrate
temperature on structural and optical properties of V2O5 thin films has been
characterized by X-ray diffraction XRD; SEM and transmission. The films mince
has been prepared by Reactive Chemical Spraying technology in Liquid Phase RCSLP
on glass substrates preheated at 350, 400, 450 and. The X-ray diffraction
analysis confirms that all layers are polycrystalline, and the preferred
orientation of V2O5 is the 001 plane. The morphology of V2O5 thin films are
porous nature and their particles shape is three-dimensional. The transmittance
and absorbance of thin film were measured from which the optical constants
Energy gap, Refractive index, Absorption coefficient, Extinction coefficient and
Optical dielectric constant were determined.

Thickness control in electrophoretic deposition of WO3 nanofiber thin films for
solar water splitting. Electrophoretic deposition EPD of ground electrospun WO3
nanofibers was applied to create photoanodes with controlled morphology for the
application of photoelectrochemical PEC water splitting. The correlations
between deposition parameters and film thicknesses were investigated with
theoretical models to precisely control the morphology of the nanostructured
porous thin film. The photoconversion efficiency was further optimized as a
function of film thickness. A maximum photoconversion efficiency of 0.924% from
electrospun WO3 nanofibers that EPD deposited on a substrate was achieved at a
film thickness of 18 m.

A Primer on Photovoltaic Generators. The most common and efficient way to covert
solar power into useful work is by photovoltaic generation. Photovoltaic cells
are devices that convert radiative energy into electric energy. This chapter
outlines the mechanism of photovoltaic conversion. The physical principles are
introduced and described, and their implementation in real devices cells and
modules is discussed with reference to the so called three solar cell
generations, namely bulk cells, thin film cells, and cells based on dye
sensitization. The role played by materials in each cell generation is also
examined.

Structure and Properties of PM Composite Materials Based on EN AW-AlCu4Mg1A
Aluminium Alloy Reinforced with the TiC,NParticles. Investigations of composite
materials based on EN AW-AlCu4Mg1A aluminum alloy reinforced with the TiC,N
particles with various weight ratios of 5, 10 and 15% are presented. The
metallographic examinations of composite materials show banding of the
reinforcing particles in aluminum matrix after extrusion process. Structure
oriented in parallel with extrusion direction is observed in composites
materials. Portion of reinforcement particles TiC,N has influence on the
mechanical properties of composite materials. The increase of hardness, abrasive
wear and decrease of compression strength, tensile strength is observed with the
portion growth of reinforcement particles.
