Effect of Ground Waste Concrete Powder on Cement Properties. The paste/mortar
attached to the recycled aggregate decreases the quality of the aggregate and
needs to be stripped. The stripped paste/mortar is roughly 20% to 50% in waste
concrete, but relevant research is very limited. In this paper, the effects of
ground waste concrete GWC powder, coming from the attached paste/mortar, on
water demand for normal consistency, setting time, fluidity, and compressive
strength of cement were analyzed. The results show that the 20% of GWC powder by
the mass of binder has little effect on the above properties and can prepare C20
concrete; when the sand made by waste red clay brick WRB replaces 20% of river
sand, the strength of the concrete is increased by 17% compared with that
without WRB sand.

Hydrogen content in titanium and a titaniumzirconium alloy after acid etching.
Dental implant alloys made from titanium and zirconium are known for their high
mechanical strength, fracture toughness and corrosion resistance in comparison
with commercially pure titanium. The aim of the study was to investigate
possible differences in the surface chemistry and/or surface topography of
titanium and titanium-zirconium surfaces after sand blasting and acid etching.
The two surfaces were compared by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, secondary
ion mass spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and profilometry. The 1.9
times greater surface hydrogen concentration of titanium zirconium compared to
titanium was found to be the major difference between the two materials.
Zirconium appeared to enhance hydride formation on titanium alloys when etched
in acid. Surface topography revealed significant differences on the micro and
nanoscale. Surface roughness was increased significantly p<0.01 on the titanium-
zirconium alloy. High-resolution images showed nanostructures only present on
titanium zirconium.

Dynamic nanoindentation of articular porcine cartilage. Articular cartilage is a
poroelastic biphasic material with a complex deformation behavior, which can be
considered elasticviscoelastic. In this article, articular porcine cartilage is
tested in vitro using dynamic nanoindentation and is analyzed using the
frequency domain. The testing and data analysis are presented as a function of
the strain rate and frequency, which allows for the results to be compared for
various load amplitudes over the same frequency range. In addition, a new
approach to correct the contact area during dynamic nanoindentation is presented
and the effects of sample freezing on the mechanical properties are also
discussed.

Microstructure and mechanical properties of AZ91D magnesium alloy prepared by
compound extrusion. Based on conventional extrusion and equal channel angular
extrusion ECAE, a new severe plastic deformation SPD method called compound
extrusion is developed to fabricate fine-grained AZ91D magnesium alloys. The
fine grain size of 6m is obtained as the accumulated strain increased to 9.146.
The AZ91D alloy treated by compound extrusion exhibits good mechanical
properties, with a yield strength of 202.2MPa, a tensile strength of 323.1MPa
and an elongation to fracture of 14.8%. The good mechanical properties of AZ91D
alloy treated by compound extrusion are due to grain refinement and to the
homogeneous distribution of intermetallic particles. The success in development
of compound extrusion proves that compound extrusion can offer a good
opportunity for the development of good mechanical properties of as-cast
magnesium alloys.

Studies on the Influence of Drying Shrinkage Test Procedure, Specimen Geometry,
and Boundary Conditions on Free Shrinkage. Although considerable progress has
been made in enhancing the use and interpretation of free ring shrinkage test,
little is known about the impact of the test procedure, the specimen geometry,
the surface area-to-volume S/V ratio exposed to drying, and the boundary
conditions sealing configuration on the measured shrinkage. This paper
highlights recent findings illustrating the influence of the test procedure, the
S/V ratio exposed to drying, the geometry of specimen, and the boundary
conditions. A series of experimental results are presented from free shrinkage
on ring test specimens to illustrate that the test procedure can significantly
influence the measured free shrinkage. A second series of experimental results
are presented from specimens with different geometries and S/V ratio exposed to
drying to illustrate that drying shrinkage is dependent on both the specimen
geometry and the surface exposed to drying. Test results further show that, even
for the same S/V ratio exposed to drying, shrinkage is strongly dependent on the
specimens geometry and boundary conditions.

Ultrathin 2D bismuth oxychloride nanosheets as novel catalytic interfaces for
detection of biomolecules. TOC graphic : Schematic representation of BiOCl
modified microchip behavior for the detection of uric acid. Highly thin bismuth
oxychloride nanosheets are grown as the catalytic interfaces to design a
microchip based sensor platform. The interface morphology consists of uniform
square shaped nanosheets, 34 nm in height. The designed microchips demonstrate
efficient detection of bioanalytes in blood. We introduce highly stable 2D
layered bismuth oxychloride nanosheets as the catalytic interfaces to bind
important biomedical analytes. Transmission electron and atomic force microscopy
revealed the prepared nanosheets possess perfect square morphology possessing
average lateral size of 200 nm, and thickness around 34 nm. We specifically
demonstrated characteristics for the binding of uric acid. When these sheets
were employed to functionalize microchips, the limit of detection was achieved
as low as 0.38 M S/N = 3. We further investigated that the modified devices
determined successfully uric acid in human blood sample. This is the first study
where ultrathin nanostructures are integrated with microchips. This work
establishes the potential of ultrathin graphene-like nanosheets to design smart
and effective interfaces for label-free binding of molecules of clinical and

Thermo-hydrogen refinement of microstructure to improve mechanical properties of
Ti6Al4V fabricated via laser powder bed fusion. This paper describes the main
results from an investigation into the consequences of thermo-hydrogen
refinement of microstructure THRM after laser powder bed fusion LPBF of Ti6Al4V
on the evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties using a set of
experimental techniques. Porosity fraction, grain structure, phases, and
crystallographic texture per phase are characterized using micro X-ray computed
tomography, microscopy, and neutron diffraction. A hierarchical structure of
acicular -phase morphology formed inside the prior grains by fast cooling during
LPBF transforms into fine-grained globular microstructure by THRM, which
facilitates homogeneous nucleation and growth of the low temperature phase with
some retained phase. Moreover, hydrogenated material during THRM has low
activation energy for diffusion, which in conjunction with the surface energy of
pores causes densification of the material, thereby closing porosity formed
during LPBF. Such significant microstructural changes induced by the THRM
treatment cause brittle material created by LPBF to become ductile.
Significantly, the strength and ductility produced by THRM exceed the minimums
set forth by the ASTM B348 standard for Ti-6Al-4V. Moreover, the treatment
improves fatigue strength of the material. In particular, it improves the
endurance limit and reduces the scatter in the measured fatigue strength data.
Performance characteristics of the material can be further optimized for
specific application requirements by tailoring microstructures using the LPBF
and THRM processes.

Tensile behavior of hybrid epoxy composite laminate containing carbon and basalt
fibers. This paper investigated the effect of the incorporation of basalt fibers
on the tensile properties of carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy laminates
manufactured by vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding. The purpose of this
research was to design a carbon-basalt/epoxy hybrid composite material that is
of low cost in production, is lightweight, and has good strength and stiffness.
The tensile strength and stiffness of the hybrid laminates demonstrated a
steady, linear decrease with an increase in basalt fiber content, but the
fracture strain gradually increased together with the increase in the basalt
layer content. In this study, the incorporation of basalt fibers into the carbon
fiber-reinforced polymer CFRP showed lower tensile strength than CFRP but has
higher tensile strain. Furthermore, we found that the arrangement and
enhancement of basalt fiber into the CFRP significantly influence the mechanical
properties of interply hybrid composites.

The Effects of Ozone Bleaching and Ozone Desizing Method on Whiteness and Water
Absorption of 100% Cotton Terry Fabrics. In this study, the effects of ozone
desizing and bleaching on the hydrophilicity and whiteness of terry fabrics were
investigated. The results were compared with those obtained after conventional
desizing and bleaching hydrogen peroxide bleaching. The test samples contain two
side piled woven terry cloths of four different areal weights. The ozone
desizing and bleaching process was carried out at fixed PH values 6 in four
different ozonation times and two different ozone doses. The rate of water
pickup in fabrics was 60%. It has been determined that as ozonation time and the
ozone dose increase, the degree of whiteness and water absorption of the terry
fabric increases. However, the increase in the ozonation time did not cause a
significant change in the low ozone doses; the change in the ozonation time at
high ozone doses is causing a marked change in the investigated properties of
the towel fabric. The degree of hydrophilicity and whiteness achieved after
ozonation was found to be close to the results obtained in conventional
bleaching. However it was seen that although acceptable water absorbency was
obtained by the ozone desizing method, these values were lower than those of the
conventional desizing method. Ozone bleaching and desizing do not require the
consumption of water, the consumption of heat energy, and the use of any
chemical additive that harms the environment with its wastes.a result, owing to
ecofriendly, saving energy and acceptable fabric properties with regard to
whiteness and absorptivity, ozone bleaching can be applied instead of the
conventional bleaching and desizing method.

Origin and development of residual stresses in the NiNiO system: in-situ studies
at high temperature by X-ray diffraction. In order to characterize the
respective importance of the growth stresses, thermal stresses and stress
relaxation developed in oxide scales, two high temperature chambers for X-ray
diffraction were designed, allowing us to determine the stresses in both the
oxide and the substrate with the sin2 technique, at high temperatures or room
temperature and during heating-cooling sequences. It was applied to NiNiO. At
room temperature after oxidation, NiO is subjected to compressive stresses whose
level depends on the substrate thickness and on the oxidation time and
temperature. In the substrate, compressive stresses are mainly due to internal
oxidation. During oxidation at, the oxide scale is subjected to slight tensile
stresses which can be due partially to anionic diffusion, internal oxidation or
the heating process. During heating-cooling sequences, the stresses in the scale
decrease with increasing temperature and become negligible when the oxidation
temperature is reached. The reversibility of the stress-temperature curve
indicates that no stress relaxation occurs. The stresses found at room
temperature are due only to thermal stresses and fit well the theoretical
calculation of thermal stresses in NiO scale based on the newly determined
thermal expansion coefficients of Ni and NiO. All these results show that the
stresses found at room temperature are mainly generated during cooling and that
the effect of the Pilling-Bedworth ratio or of factors playing a role during
isothermal growth is negligible.

Multilayer graphene and -Si3N4 whisker-reinforced porous Si3N4 ceramics by spark
plasma incomplete sintering. Combining the advantages of spark plasma sintering
SPS and incomplete sintering IS in preparation of Si3N4 ceramics, the spark
plasma incomplete sintering SPIS was presented to fabricate porous Si3N4
ceramics. Considering balancing the contradictory relationship between the
porosity and toughness, 1 wt% multilayer graphene MLG was incorporated into
porous Si3N4 ceramics. Meanwhile, for the sake of compensating for the decrease
in the hardness of porous Si3N4 ceramics induced by MLG, 08 wt% -Si3N4 whisker
-Si3N4 w were synergistically added. The element distribution, phase
constitutions and microstructures of MLG/-Si3N4 w -reinforced porous Si3N4
ceramics were characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy EDS, x-rays
diffraction XRD and scanning electron microscope SEM. The effects of -Si3N4 w
content on porosity, hardness and fracture toughness of porous Si3N4 -based
ceramics were analyzed. Results indicated that the porosity of porous Si3N4
-based ceramics reached 21%, and then decreased significantly after the -Si3N4 w
content exceeded 4 wt%. The hardness of porous Si3N4 -based ceramics obtained
the maximum value 2.81 GPa when - Si3N4 w was added 8 wt%, which was 31.92%
higher than monolithic porous Si3N4 ceramic. The mass transfer, diffusion and
fusion induced by -Si3N4 w were considered to be the main responsible for the
increase of hardness. The fracture toughness of specimen with 1 wt% MLG and 4
wt% -Si3N4 w was advanced to 3.14 MPa m 1/2/ , which was 15.44% higher than
monolithic porous Si3N4 ceramic. The markedly enhanced of the fracture toughness
was attributed to the synergistic effects of crack deflection, pull-out and
bridging resulted by MLG/-Si3N4 w . Spark plasma incomplete sintering was
proposed to fabricate porous Si3N4 ceramics. MLG/-Si3N4 w were doped into porous
Si3N4 ceramics to advance its strength. MLG/-Si3N4 w -enhanced Si3N4 ceramics
with a porosity of 21% were prepared at. Hardness of MLG/-Si3N4 w -reinforced
porous Si3N4 ceramics reached 2.81 GPa. Fracture toughness of porous Si3N4

partly crystallized owing to the rise in temperature during spraying, whereas
the layer on the copper substrate, 1.5 mm thick, remained amorphous. The maximum

Scarf Repair of Composite Laminates. The use of composite materials, such as
carbon-fiber reinforced plastic CFRP composites, aero- structures has led to an
increased need of advanced assembly joining and repair technologies. Adhesive
bonded repairs as an alternative to recover full or part of initial strength
were investigated. Tests were conducted with the objective of evaluating the
effectiveness of techniques used for repairing damage fiber reinforced laminated
composites. Failure loads and failure modes were generated and compared with the
following parameters: scarf angles, roughness of grind tool and number of
external plies. Results showed that scarf angle was the critical parameter and
the largest tensile strength was observed with the smallest scarf angle.
Besides, the use of external plies at the outer surface could not increase the
repairs efficiency for large scarf angle. Preparing the repair surfaces by
sanding them with a sander ranging from 60 to 100 grit number had significant
effect on the failure load. These results allowed the proposal of design
principles for repairing CFRP structures.

Integration of -cyclodextrin into graphene quantum dot nano-structure and its
application towards detection of Vitamin C at physiological pH: A new
electrochemical approach. For the first time, -Cyclodextrin -CD attachment to
graphene quantum dot GQD structure was performed using simultaneous
electrodeposition of GQD and -CD on the surface of glassy carbon electrode GCE.
Cyclic voltammetry at potential range -1.0 to 1.0V from mixture of GQD and -CD
produced a well-defined -CD-GQD deposited on the surface of glassy carbon
electrode. -CD-GQD modified GCE was used as a new electrocatalytical
nanocomposite towards electrooxidation of Vitamin C as sample analyte. The
synergistic effects and the catalytic activity of the -CD-GQD modified GCE were
investigated by cyclic voltammetry CV, differential pulse voltammetry DPV
chronoamperometry CA and square wave voltammetry SWV. The process of oxidation
involved and its kinetics were established by using cyclic voltammetry,
chronoamperometry techniques. It has been found that in the course of an anodic
potential sweep the electro-oxidation of Vitamin C is catalyzed by synergetic
effect of -CD and GQD through a mediated electron transfer mechanism. Therefore,
-CD-GQDs promote the rate of oxidation by increasing the peak current. The
cyclic voltammetric results indicate that -CD-GQDs-GCE can remarkably enhance
electroactivity towards the oxidation of Vitamin C in buffer solution. We have
illustrated that the as-obtained -CD-GQDs-GCE exhibited a much higher
electrocatalytical behavior thanfor the electrooxidation and detection of
Vitamin C which was about two fold higher than for The electrochemical behavior
was further exploited as detection scheme for the Vitamin C electrooxidation by
square wave voltammetry.

High-temperature mechanical properties of 2024 Al matrix nanocomposite
reinforced by TiC network architecture. In this work, 2024 Al matrix composite
reinforced by 1.5 wt% in-situ synthesized TiC nanoparticles has been fabricated
by casting method. It was found that TiC nanoparticles were distributed along
-Al grain boundaries, which formed network architecture, and average cell size
of the TiC network was 48m. The 20241.5TiC nanocomposite exhibited enhanced
mechanical properties compared to 2024 base alloy. The ultimate tensile strength
at was increased from 105MPa to 151MPa, with elongation reasonably decreasing
from 9.5% to 7.1%. It was observed that the presence of the TiC network
transformed deformation behavior of -Al matrix from local deformation to overall
deformation during tensile test at high temperature. This enhanced strength of
the 20241.5TiC, which contributed to ~84% increase in yield strength
theoretically. Accordingly, a new strengthening mechanism named as constraint
strengthening has been put forward in this paper. This principle was supposed to
be applicable for microstructure design of other alloys and composites. In
addition, the circle network was shifted to be oval one during deformation, but
the interconnectivity has not been broken. This produced reasonably high
ductility for the 20241.5TiC nanocomposite.

Soybean-modified polyamide-6 mats as a long-term cutaneous wound covering.
Engineered skin coverings have been adopted clinically to support extensive and
deep wounds that result in fewer healthy skin remaining and therefore take
longer to heal. Nonetheless, these biomaterials demand intensive labor and an
expensive final cost. In comparison to conventional bandages, which do not meet
all the requirements of wound care, electrospun fiber mats could potentially
provide an excellent environment for healing. In this work, we developed two
nanostructured scaffolds based on polyamide-6 PA-6 to be tested as a wound
covering in a rat model of full-thickness incisional wound healing. The central
idea was to create a bioconstruct that is simple to implement and biologically
safe, with a high survival rate, which provides physical support and biological
recognition for new functional tissues. An unmodified PA-6 and a soybean-
modified PA-6 were employed as nanofibrillar matrices in this study. The
biomaterials showed a dimensional homology to natural extracellular matrix
components and neither in vitro toxicity nor in vivo side effects. Both
polymeric scaffolds were resistant to the sterilization process and could
promote the attachment of 3T3 fibroblast cells, besides successfully
incorporating the growth factor PDGF-BB, which had its bioactivity extended for
up to 12 h under simulated conditions. The modification of PA-6 chains with a
fatty acid derivative increased the scaffold's surface free energy, favoring
cell proliferation, collagen formation, and ECM secretion. These results confirm
the potential of these materials as a topical dermal covering for skin
regeneration.

BeckeJohnson exchangecorrelation potentials TB09. Both LDA+U and G0W0
calculations are accurate for the indirect band gap, but fail for the direct
one. While QPscGW calculations do perturbative corrections to both G0W0 indirect
and direct band gap in the same amount, it is leading to an overestimation of
the indirect band gap and an underestimation of the direct one at the same time.
Besides, the indirect and direct band gap of the optimized lattice parameters
are calculated by ABINIT code with TB09 exchange functional and they are
underestimated by about 1% and 17%, respectively. For comparison purposes with
the experimental values, the band structure is also calculated by ELK code with
TB09 and with a minuscule amount of charge removed from its primitive unit cell.
With a charge removal by 0.86 both band gaps are very close to the experimental
values, with an error of about 0.2% for the indirect band gap and about 0.9% for
the direct one. Finally, the dielectric function and optical conductivity of the
bulk CuBO2 are calculated by random phase approximation RPA and time-dependent
density functional theory TDDFT on top of the TB09 electronic structure.

Thermodynamics Calculation of Extra Mn Addition in the Recycling of
AlSiCuAluminium Alloys. Iron contamination from scrapped materials is always a
problem in producing high quality secondary aluminium alloys. Consequently, the
iron removal during recycling of aluminium alloys is essential and important in
industrial practice. This work aims to study the effect of extra Mn addition on
the effectiveness and efficiency of iron removal during recycling. The
thermodynamics assessment was carried out for AlSiCu alloys to find out the
variation of balanced iron and manganese in the liquid melt and in the sediment
solid Fe-rich intermetallics with different levels of extra Mn addition. The
effect of alloy composition and processing temperatures was investigated. The
findings help to understand the capability and fundamentals of iron removal in
aluminium alloys.

Effect of magnesium on mechanical properties of alumina-fiber-reinforced
aluminum matrix composites formed by pressure infiltration casting. AlAl2O3
composites containing 0.48%6.8% Mg in the matrix alloys have been fabricated by
pressure infiltration casting. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy
and image analysis were used to examine and to analyze the details of the
microstructure and the fracture surface. Tensils tests were utilized to evaluate
the mechanical properties. The addition of magnesium was found to improve the
infiltration and to decrease the porosity of the composites. The tensile
strength of the composites increased with increased magnesium content, while
elongation remained almost constant 10%.

Gaussian distribution in current-conduction mechanism of Ni/PtSchottky contacts
on wide bandgap AlInGaN quaternary alloy. The current-conduction mechanisms of
the as-deposited and annealed at Ni/PtSchottky contacts on AlInGaN quaternary
alloy have been investigated in the temperature range of. The zero-bias barrier
height BHB0 and ideality factor n of them were evaluated using thermionic
emission TE theory. The B0 and n values calculated from the IV characteristics
show a strong temperature dependence. Such behavior of B0 and n is attributed to
Schottky barrier inhomogeneities. Therefore, both the B0 vs n and B0 vs q/2kT
plots were drawn to obtain evidence on the Gaussian distribution GD of the
barrier height at the metal/semiconductor interface. These plots show two
different linear parts at low and intermediate temperatures for as-deposited and
annealed Schottky contacts. Thus, the mean value of B0 and standard deviation 0
was calculated from the linear parts of the B0 vs q/kT plots for both samples.
The values of the effective Richardson constant A and mean BH were obtained from
the modified Richardson plots which included the effect of barrier
inhomogeneity. These values of Richardson constant and barrier height for as-
deposited contacts were found to be 19.9Acm2K2 and 0.59eV, respectively, at low
temperature, but 43.3Acm2K2 and 1.32eV, respectively, at intermediate
temperatures. These values of Richardson constant and barrier height for
annealed contacts were found to be 19.6Acm2K2 and 0.37eV, respectively, at low
temperature, but 42.9Acm2K2 and 1.54eV, respectively, at intermediate
temperatures. It is clear that the value of the Richardson constant obtained for
as-deposited and annealed samples by using double-GD for intermediate
temperatures is close to the theoretical value of AlInGaN =44.7Acm2K2.
Therefore, IV-T characteristics for the as-deposited and annealed Schottky

Radiation effects in silicon detectors processed on carbon and oxygen-rich
substrates. Radiation hardness results of silicon detectors fabricated on bulk
float-zone FZ material enriched either by carbon or by oxygen are reported. The
detectors were irradiated by nuclear reactor neutrons, by 24GeV/ c protons and
by 192MeV pions. It has been shown that the leakage current increases with
fluence equally in all silicon detectors under study, regardless of the oxygen
or carbon concentrations. The variations in the space-charge density were found
to be very different in the oxygen and carbon-enriched materials in the case of
irradiation by charged particles, yet rather similar in case of neutrons.

Effect of Surface Roughness on the Adhesion of Elastomers to Hard Surfaces. The
work presented started with the aim of trying to explain why clean smooth
surfaces of materials such as metals brought gently into contact show no
adhesion. The observation by Johnson Kendall &amp; Roberts of adhesion between
smooth surfaces of an elastomeric hemisphere and a rigid substrate suggested a
model contact system with which the effect of surface roughness could be
investigated experimentally. Moreover the Johnson-Kendal-Roberts JKR contact
theory could be used to predict the effect of roughness on adhesion. The
observations and predictions obtained are compared, and the implications for the
contact of two rigid materials outlined. The limitations of the validity of the
predictions are mentioned. Further studies of the adhesion to rough surfaces, in
particular the phenomenon of enhanced adhesion at low roughness, will be
discussed. Finally, more recent theoretical work is briefly referred to.

formed, including Ti2O followed by CuTiO compounds at the ceramic side and CuTi
intermetallics at the Ti workpiece side. The overall interface microstructure
was different when TZP was brazed to itself, yet the reaction product adjacent

The electrical characteristics of Ni/n-GaSbSchottky diode. The junction
characteristics of the Ni/n-GaSbSchottky diode were discussed on the basis of
temperature-dependent currentvoltage IV-T measurements. The barrier height and
ideality factor assuming thermionic emission TE theory shows strong temperature
dependence. The Schottky barrier increases from 0.28 to 0.48eV as the measured
temperature increases from 173 to, while the ideality decreases from 1.82 to
1.15. The series resistance also increases as the measured temperature decreases
due to the decrease of carrier concentration. The barrier height is plotted
against q/2kT to obtain evidence of the Gaussian distribution of the barrier
heights and because of barrier height inhomogeneities. From this plot, the mean
barrier height and standard deviation at zero bias for as-deposited Ni/n-GaSb
diode were 0.66eV and 0.107V, respectively. Furthermore, from a modified
Richardson plot, ln J s / T 2 q 2 S02 / 2 k 2 T 2 versus 1000/T, the activation
energy and the Richardson constant values obtained were 0.66eV and 6.21A-K2cm2,

Proper pH value enhances giant magneto-impedance effect of FINEMET/rGO composite
ribbons by electroless plating. Electromagnetic interaction in composite
structure materials has been a crucial physical mechanism to optimize magnetic
property of magnetic devices. In this paper, the composite ribbons of FINEMET
coated with reduced graphene oxide rGO were successfully prepared by electroless
plating method at different pH values. The structure, morphology and magnetic
properties of the FINEMET/rGO composite ribbons were characterized by X-Ray
diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, giant magneto-
impedance GMI analysis and vibrating sample magnetometer techniques,
respectively. The resultsshowed that the peak position field of composite ribbon
first decreases and then increases with the variation of pH value, which
indicated that there may be existed electromagnetic interaction and stress
between rGO and the FINEMET ribbon. The electromagnetic interaction may lead to
the redistribution of current density and the change of skin depth. An
interpretation in terms of electromagnetic interaction between rGO and FINEMET
ribbon was proposed, which provided a new perspective for analyzing the
variation in GMI effect of composite materials.

established that according to the Jonscher law. ac is described by Non-
overlapping Small Polaron Tunneling model at low temperatures and Correlated
Barrier Hopping model at high temperatures. From dc conductance analysis,
conduction seems to be thermally activated, suggesting the existence of
semiconductor process. Detailed investigation of impedance data revealed the
non-Debye nature of the relaxation processes in the sample. In addition,
Dielectric constant curves were applied to examine the relaxation dynamics of
charge carriers. In fact, the Debye-like relaxation was performed on the basis
of the polarization of spatial charges following Maxwell-Wagner model and Koops
phenomenological theory.

Ion Tracks in Polymers. Ion tracks were discovered by Young in 1958 1, as he
examined etch pits in fission-fragment-irradiated LiF by means of scanning
electron microscopy. In1959 , Silk and Barnes 2 observed latent fission-fragment
tracks in mica in the transmission electron microscope. These discoveries
prompted the development of research on ion tracks until now, including track-
etching techniques for particle detection and identification, and their use in
several areas of science and technology such as geochronology and radiation
dosimetry 3, 4. In these applications, mostly natural minerals and synthetic
polymers have served as ion-track detectors. At the same time, inorganic and
polymeric track membranes, produced by ion irradiation and subsequent etching,
have found applications in microfiltration 5 and gas-separation 6 technologies.
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that track etching can be useful in
lithography 7, and that microcomponents for electronic and mechanical devices
can be fabricated by track replications 810. Some of these applications will be

Mechanical Surface Treatment Technologies for Improving HCFStrength and Surface
Roughness of Blisk-Rotors. The manufacturing of electron beam welded blade
integrated disk blisk rotors sets new demands on mechanical surface treatment
technologies. High durability and high efficiency of the blades are in general
strict requirements for the component and have ideally to be increased by a
mechanical surface treatment. The high complex 3D shape of the blades and the
need to treat the blades on the rotor caused by a post weld heat treatment are
additional challenges to solve. Limited clearance between the blades and low
space between the individual blisks increase as well the requirements on the
technology. Conventional technologies reach their limits and have to be
improved. This paper gives an insight into the capabilities of different
mechanical surface treatments regarding the treatment of blades on blisk-rotors.
Compared with the benchmark shot peening, surface roughness, residual stress
depth distribution and high cycle fatigue HCF are investigated on deep rolled
and vibropeened specimen. Assets and drawbacks are shown and discussed.

Strain rate and orientation-dependent strain hardening of Mg9LiAl using crystal
plasticity. A crystal plasticity finite element model was proposed considering
slip and twinning interactions. The grain morphology and crystallographic
orientations were introduced into the model to describe the microstructure of
duplex polycrystalline Mg9LiAl. The activation of the slip systems and the
strain localisation with respect to initial grain orientations were
investigated. In addition, the effects of phase distributions and volume
fractions on the macroscopic responses and on strain hardening rates were
analysed. The results show that the strain hardening is rate-dependent but the
texture is less sensitive to strain rate. The distribution of a phase and its
volume fraction play primary roles in governing the mechanical response.

Utilization of sugarcane bagasse ash in concrete as partial replacement of
cement. This research addresses the suitability of sugarcane bagasse ash SCBA in
concrete used as partial cement replacement. Two grades of concrete M15 and M20
were used for the experimental analysis. The cement was partially replaced by
SCBA at 0%, 5%, and 10%, by weight in normal strength concrete NSC. The
innovative part of this study is to consider two grades of concrete mixes to
evaluate the performance of concrete while cement is replaced by sugarcane
bagasse ash. The cylindrical specimens having size 150 mm 300 mm were used and
tested after curing period of 7, 14 and 28 days. It was observed through the
experimental work that the compressive strength increases with incorporating
SCBA in concrete. Results indicated that the use of SCBA in concrete M20 at 5%
increased the average amount of compressive strength by 12% as compared to the
normal strength concrete. The outcome of this work indicates that maximum
strength of concrete could be attained at 5% replacement of cement with SCBA.
Furthermore, the SCBA also gives compatible slump values which increase the
workability of concrete.

Fatigue crack propagation in salt water, air and high vacuum in a spray-formed
particulate-reinforced metal matrix composite. Fatigue crack in salt water, air
and high vacuum was studied in a spray-formed 2618 Al alloy reinforced with 15
vol.% SiC particulates and in the corresponding unreinforced alloy. The
composite exhibited better fatigue crack growth resistance than the monolithic
alloy in the three environments, although the differences decreased as the crack
growth rate increased. The differences in the fatigue crack growth rates between
the two materials were attributed to the higher closure levels in the composite,
induced by its smaller crack-opening displacements. The presence of SiC
particulates did not modify the susceptibility of this Al alloy to corrosion
fatigue, the crack growth rates being maxima in salt water and minima in high

Fatigue failure under stress below fatigue limit - From the viewpoint of
internal stress.. The stress applied to a specimen does not fully act to deform
material. The effective stress which actually acts on dislocations can be
related to the internal stress of material. The origin of internal stress and
thus effective stress has been discussed here by means of a dislocation model,
concluding that internal stress depends on the dislocation structure. Based on
this conclusion, fatigue tests were carried out and the following results were
obtained:1 The behavior of internal stress in the fatigue process showed a clear
difference between the over-stressed and the under-stressed conditions.2 The
fatigue failure occurred under many-fold multiple repeated stress in two stress
levels below the fatigue limit. Such fracture was attributed to the instability
of internal stress.3 The concept of internal stress and effective stress is
useful to the comprehensive understanding of fatigue phenomenon.

The strength of glass fibre reinforcement after exposure to elevated composite
processing temperatures. The results of a study on the properties of glass
fibres after thermal conditioning at typical engineering thermoplastic
processing temperatures are presented. The mechanical performance of rovings and
single fibres of well-defined silane- and water-sized E-glass fibre samples was
investigated at room temperature after thermal conditioning at temperatures up
to. Thermal conditioning for 15 min led to strength degradation of >50 % at
higher temperatures. The tensile strength of silane-coated fibres was relatively
stable up to but exhibited a precipitous drop at higher conditioning
temperatures. The water-sized fibres exhibited an approximately linear decrease
in strength with increasing conditioning temperature. The strength distribution
of the water-sized fibres could be well represented by a unimodal three-
parameter Weibull distribution. The strength distributions of the sized fibres
were more complicated and required the use of a bimodal Weibull distribution.
The results are discussed in terms of the changes in surface coating and bulk
glass structure during heat conditioning.

A compare of electrical characteristics in Al/p-Si MS and Al/C20H12/p-Si MPS
type diodes using currentvoltage 4+ and capacitancevoltage CV measurements. In
this study, both the metal-semiconductor MS and metal-polymer-semiconductor MPS,
Al/C20H12/p-Si, type Schottky barrier diodeswere fabricated using spin coating
method and they were called as D1 and D2 diodes, respectively. Their electrical
characterization have been investigated and compared using the forward and
reverse bias IV and CV measurements at room temperature. The main electrical
parameters such as ideality factor n, reverse saturation current Io, zero-bias
barrier height Bo, seriesand shunt Rsh resistances, energy dependent profile of
interface states Nss, the doping concentration of acceptor atoms NA and
depletion layer width WD were determined and compared each other and literature.
The rectifying ratio RR and leakage current IR at 3V were found as 2.06103,
1.61106A and 15.7103, 2.75107A for D1 and D2, respectively. Similarly, theand
Rsh values of these diodes were found as 544, 10.7M and 716 and 1.83M using Ohms
Law, respectively. In addition, energy and voltage dependent profiles of Nss
were obtained using the forward bias IV data by taking into account voltage
dependent effective barrier height e and n and low-high frequency capacitance
CLFCHF methods, respectively. The obtained value of Nss for D2 MPS diode at
about the mid-gap of Si is about two times lower than D1 MS type diode.
Experimental results confirmed that the performance in MPS type SBD is
considerably high according to MS diode in the respect of lower values of
Nss,and Io and higher values of RR and Rsh.

Application of crystalline silicon solar cells in photovoltaic modules. Purpose:
The aim of the paper is to determinate basic electrical properties of solar
cells, made of them photovoltaic module and analysis of its main electrical
parameters. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, several methods were
used: current voltage characteristic to determinate basic electrical properties
of 36 monocrystalline silicon solar cells, soft soldering technique to bond
solar cells . Photovoltaic module was produced from 31 solar cells with the
largest short-circuit current, which were joined in series. Findings: In order
to obtain a device producing an electrical current with a higher current and
voltage level, solar cells were connected in a photovoltaic module and then
protected from damages derived from external factors. In series connection solar
cell with the lowest current determines the current flowing in the PV module.
Taking this fact into account the analysis of photovoltaic module construction
was performed. Practical implications: Because of low operating cost and
simplicity of photovoltaic installation, photovoltaic technology is perfectly
suitable for supplying objects which are beyond powers network range as well as
connected to it. In many cases, they are less costly option than a direct
extension of the power network. Originality/value: Protecting the environment
from degradation due to pollution, which has source in conventional power
industry, as well as diminishing resources of fossil fuels, tend to increase
development of renewable energy production such as photovoltaic technology.

Nonlinear mechanical behaviour of cemented soils. This paper investigates the
nonlinear mechanical behaviour of cemented soils and cement-based grouted soils
viewed as multiphase materials. A secant linearization procedure has been
coupled to the Homogenization of Periodic Media in order to determine the
macroscopic behaviour of such structured soils from the knowledge of the
individual constituents behaviour and a detailed description of the
microstructure. The proposed approach allows to overcome mesh-dependency and
divergence problems encountered by direct methods in presence of softening laws.
Isotropic elastic damage behaviour is retained for the cement matrix, on the
basis of existing triaxial tests. The confrontation with experimental triaxial
tests on grouted soils has led us to introduce frictional aspects, which has
allowed to improve the model in terms of peak stress and dilation
characteristics.

Effect of weld metal toughness on fracture behavior under ultra-low cycle
fatigue loading earthquake. Results from 12 ultra-low cycle fatigue tests
performed on the weld metals of both toughness and non-toughness rated grades
are presented. Fracture resistance under these loadings seemed to be dependent
on materials' toughness, displacement amplitude, and stress state triaxiality,
while the toughness effect was more highlighted at high stress levels and
concentrations. To study the effect of microstructures on these failures,
supporting ancillary tests including all-weld tension coupons, Charpy V-notched
impact tests, and optical and scanning electron microscope analyses were
performed. The favored microstructures appeared to be those which absorbed
energy by plastic deformation and, hence, hindered void formation and/or could
avoid crack propagation by deflection. Considering the response of the tested
materials to cyclic loadings and the requirements of the materials specified in
AISC341 Provisions could question the adequacy of these requirements for weld
metals. However, the role of microstructural features like inclusions would be
the same in both the Charpy impact tests and ultra-low cycle loadings.

Effects of plasma shield plate design on epitaxial GaN films grown for large-
sized wafers in radical-enhanced metalorganic chemical vapor deposition.
Epitaxial growth of GaN films at a low temperature of was studied in radical-
enhanced metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, focusing on the discharge
region of the plasma of a mixture of N2 and H2 gases. The effect of plasma
confinement on the growth is crucial for realizing high crystal quality of grown
GaN films, owing to the suppression of plasma-induced damage and decomposition
of gallium precursors in the gaseous phase. By confined plasma in the discharge
region using the plasma shield plates made of metal with multiple small holes
effectively, GaN with a relatively flat surface was grown under conditions of
higher V/III ratios. Epitaxial growth of GaN films was achieved by modifying the
plate design and controlling the high V/III ratio using both the plasma-
excitation power and the Ga precursor flow rate.

Thermoelectric properties of SiC thick films deposited by thermal plasma
physical vapor deposition. SiC thick films of about 300 m could be prepared with
a deposition rate above 300 nm/s by thermal plasma physical vapor deposition
TPPVD using ultrafine SiC powder as a starting material. The thermoelectric
properties were investigated as a function of composition and doping content.
The nondoped films showed n-type conduction. Although the Seebeck coefficient
reached as high as 480 V/K, the power factor was only around 1.6104 W m1 K2 at
due to the relatively high electrical resistivity. In order to reduce the
electrical resistivity and to deposit layers with n-type and p-type conduction,
N2, B and B4C were selected as the dopants. Nitrogen-doped samples exhibit
n-type characterization, B and B4C-doped samples exhibit p-type
characterization, and the electrical resistivity decreased from 102103 to 104105
m after doping. The maximum power factor of the nitrogen-doped SiC and the thick
films deposited with B4C powder reached 1.0103 and 6.4104 W m1 K2 at,
respectively.

Effect of grain size on fatigue cracking at twin boundaries in a CoCrFeMnNi
high-entropy alloy. The fatigue cracking behavior at twin boundariesin a
CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy with three different grain sizes was
systematically investigated under low-cycle fatigue. Irrespective of grain size,
the change from slip band cracking to TB cracking occurred with increasing the
difference in the Schmid factors DSF between matrix and twin. However, the
required critical DSF for the transition of the dominant cracking mode decreases
with decreasing grain size due to the reduced slip band spacing that increases
the impingement sites on theand facilitates the coalescence of defects and voids
to initiate TB cracks.

for getting desirable fabric quality some potential steps follow to reduce
fabric fault through process control parameters analysis and reliable
measurements for optimizing defects in knitted finished fabrics to scrutinize
quality of finished fabrics. At present, quality of fabric is a great concern
tones this modern textile arena. Quality is the most perspective demand in the
produced textile fabrics which mainly viable by two factors one is fabric
properties and other fabric defects. We have done our experimental part with
some process controlling data for six knit fabrics and we got shrinkage is the

by controlling parameters in a daily basis of production area. This paper deals
about optimizing defects with process parameters to ameliorate the quality of

Lapping flat surfaces with forced dosing of abrasive suspension. The issues
concerning the finishing of flat ceramic seals are presented in the paper. The
treatment requirements demanded from the elements of that type cause, that
necessary is application of grinding-in in the technological process. Such a
precise abrasive treatment of flat surfaces of that type, requires the use of an
appropriate suspended matter or abrasive paste. Many factors connected with
metal grinding-in shield, components of abrasive suspended matter and the
treatments technological conditions, have an impact on the treatments result.
The manner and intensity of the suspended matters proportioning in the grinding-
in are, are also of decisive nature. A standard, free manner of proportioning,
in a continuous manner most often dipping or dropping, results in big losses of
abrasive material. A part of abrasive micro-grains is quickly removed from the
operating grinding-in shield by the rotating rings leading separators with
treated elements and does not take part at all in machine cutting. It
considerably increases the tool costs and has an unfavourable impact on the
natural environment. Implementation of the forced abrasive suspended matters
proportioning at the time of the machine grinding-in, considerably reduces these
losses.

Microstructure and properties of extruded Al6Mg3Cr alloy prepared from rapidly

relationship between processing, microstructure, and mechanical properties of an
Al6Mg3Cr powder alloy consolidated by extrusion. Attention is focused on the
microstructure of the powder and the subsequent changes that occurred during
thermomechanical consolidation to a fully dense product. The powder
microstructure was composed of aggregates of three equilibrium phases
Al18Mg3Cr2, Al3Mg2, and Al13Cr2 which were uniformly distributed within an Al
matrix. Preheating to the extrusion temperature by induction had very little
effect on the microstructure. However, consolidation of the powder accompanied
by significant structural changes occurred during passage through the extrusion
shear zone. The extruded microstructure was found to be inhomogeneous with
coarse and fine bands of precipitates throughout. The inhomogeneities of
extrudate microstructure have been related to the original powder and were

Electrochemical characterization of a responsive macromolecular interface on
gold. This study reports on the investigation of a thermoresponsive polymer as a
thin film on electrodes and the influence of coupling a peptide and an antibody
to the film. The utilized polymer from the class of polyoligoethylene glycol-
methacrylate polymers polyOEGMA with carboxy functions containing side chains
was synthesized and properly characterized in aqueous solutions. The dependence
of the cloud point on the pH of the surrounding media is discussed. The
responsive polymer was immobilized on gold electrodes as shown by
electrochemical, quartz crystal microbalance QCM, and atomic force microscopy
AFM techniques. The temperature dependent behavior of the polymer covalently
grafted to gold substrates is investigated using cyclic voltammetry CV in
ferro-/ferricyanide solution. Significant changes in the slope of the
temperature-dependence of the voltammetric peak current and the peak separation
values clearly indicate the thermally induced conformational change on the
surface. Finally, a biorecognition reaction between a short FLAG peptide NAsp-
Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-C covalently immobilized on the polymer interface
and the corresponding IgG antibody was performed. The study shows that the
responsiveness of the electrode is retained after peptide coupling and antibody
binding, although the response is diminished.

The effect of in-plane strain on the electronic properties of LaAlO3/SrTiO3
interface. The effect of in-plane strain on the LaAlO3 /SrTiO3 interface is
investigated. The roughness of the interface becomes larger with decreasing
lattice constant. The interfacial Ti3 d xy electrons is the origin of the 2DEG
formed at the interface. In-plane strain can tailor the 2DEG and induce a metal-
insulator transition. The density functional theory DFT calculations are
employed to investigate the effect of in-plane strain on the lattice relaxation
and electronic properties of LaAlO3 /SrTiO3 interface. It is obtained that the
in-plane strain influences the lattice relaxation obviously. The distortion of
interfacial TiO octahedron is enhanced with the increasing of the in-plane
compressive strain. The Ti3 d xy orbital at the interface is partly filled and
it is the origin of the interfacial two-dimensional electron gas 2DEG. The in-
plane strain can effectively modulate the carrier concentration and consequently
the conductivity of the 2DEG formed at the interface. In-plane strain may reduce
the carrier concentration significantly and induce a metal-insulator transition
when the in-plane compressive tensile strain is added up to 4.98% 5.29%.

On Structural Stability of Nanostructured Aluminium. Nano- and submicron-
structured aluminium was produced by equal channel angular extrusion with a
total strain of ~17. Large residual stress and strain energy were built up in
the extruded metal and subsequent heat treatments were applied to investigate
the stability of the nanostructures. X-ray diffractometry and transmission
electron microscopy were performed to evaluate the microstructural changes in
the nanograin metal. It was found that the nanostructures remained stable at
temperatures up to. Above, changes in the major x-ray peak reflections became
evident, suggesting substantial grain growth had occurred. Electron microscopy
confirmed that at low annealing temperatures, the fine grain structures were
stable and indeed became more equiaxed and well defined.

Effect of TiN coating on corrosion fatigue strength of carbon steel.. In order
to investigate the effect of titanium nitride TiN coating on corrosion fatigue
behavior of metal, cantilever-type rotating bending corrosion fatigue tests were
carried out in 3.0% saline solution by using the round bar specimens of 0.37%C
carbon steel, JIS S35C, coated with TiN by the physical vapour deposition PVD
method or the chemical vapour deposition CVD method. From the experimental
results, obvious improvement of corrosion fatigue strength was observed in TiN
coated specimens, as compared with those without coating. The corrosion fatigue
crack propagation rate observed on the surface of coated specimens was
equivalent to that without coating. Fracture surface observations with a
scanning-electron microscope revealed that the corrosion fatigue crack
propagated from small corrosion pits formed at the base metal under the coating
layer due to aqueous solution transmitted throughout the small pinhole or flaw
of the coating. The causes of the improvement in the corrosion fatigue
resistance of TiN coated material were elucidated that the TiN layer does not
peel off from the substrate surface owing to its enough adhesion and corrosion
resistance of the layer itself is more excellent than that of the substrate
metal.

Modeling Solid-State Phase Transformations ofr-4NiSteels in Welding Heat-
Affected Zone. Fatigue damage is commonly encountered by operators of Francis
type hydraulic turbine runners made ofr-4Ni soft martensitic stainless steel.
These large and complex welded casting assemblies are subjected to fatigue crack
initiation and growth in the vicinity of their welded regions. It is well known
that fatigue behavior is influenced by residual stresses and the microstructure.
By including solid-state phase transformation models in welding simulations,
phase distribution can be evaluated along with their respective volumetric
change and their effect on residual stresses. Thus, it enables the assessment of
welding process on fatigue crack behavior by numerical methods. This paper
focuses on modeling solid-state phase transformations ofr-4Ni soft martensitic
stainless steel, used for manufacturing hydraulic turbine runners, occurring
upon welding. It proposes to determine the material parameters of the models for
both the austenitic and the martensitic transformation by nonisothermal
dilatometry tests. The experiments are conducted in a quenching dilatometer with
applied thermal conditions as experienced in the heat-affected zone of
homogeneous welds. The activation energy and the kinetic parameters of the
austenitic transformation from fully martensitic state are measured from the
experimental results. The martensitic transformation modeling from a fully
austenitic domain is also presented.

The superiority of superalloys. The structure and properties of superalloys and
the phase that forms their principal component are described. The properties of
each phase and the relation between the properties of the two phases combine to
produce the superior performance of superalloys. Nickel-based superalloys seem
to have reached the stage at which only modest incremental improvements in
performance seem likely. Major advances will be based on other alloy systems.
Will their performance be based on a different set of principles, or will it
depend on considerations very similar to those that account for the success of
the current superalloys? One of the strongest candidates for the next generation
of high-temperature creep-resistant alloys, the system TiAlTi3Al, is shown to
have many features in common with those of superalloys.

TTT diagrams of 1424 alloy system AlLiMgScZr within temperature interval for
quench sensitivity and temperature interval for ageing were obtained. Solid
solution decomposition kinetics were determined by electroconductivity and
tensile properties measurements. Phase transformations have been investigated
using by high sensitivity X-ray phase analysis, TEM, EDX and DSC. Cooling rate
at quenching enough to suppress solid solution decomposition estimated by , UTS
and YS changes criteria is equal to s 1 . At temperature interval , UTS and YS
were changed with peak near temperature of the minimal stability after the
endurance 14 min. TTT diagram showed, that the solid solution decomposition with
precipitation of S1 -phase Al2MgLi in temperature range begins with minimal used

Pushing the frontiers of modeling excited electronic states and dynamics to
accelerate materials engineering and design. Electronic excitations and their
dynamics are oftentimes at the foundation of how we use and probe materials.
While recent experimental advances allow us to do so with unprecedented accuracy
and time resolution, their interpretation relies on solid theoretical
understanding. This can be provided by cutting-edge, first-principles
theoretical-spectroscopy based on many-body perturbation theory MBPT and time-
dependent density functional theory TDDFT. In this work we review some of our
recent results as successful examples for how electronic-structure methods lead
to interesting insight into electronic excitations and deep understanding of
modern materials. In many cases these techniques are accurate and even
predictive, yet they rely on approximations to be computationally feasible. We
illustrate the need for further theoretical understanding, using dielectric
screening as an example in MBPT and faster, more accurate numerical integrators
as a challenge for real-time TDDFT. Finally, we describe how incorporating
online databases into computational materials research on excited electronic
states can side-step the problem of high computational cost to facilitate
materials design.

Structure and properties of sintered titanium alloyed with aluminium, molybdenum
and oxygen. Titanium alloys of TiAlMoO system were manufactured by blended
elemental powder method using Ti, Al, Mo and TiO2 powders as starting materials.
It was found that cold compaction pressure of 800 MPa followed by sintering at,
for 4 h provided sufficient densification of titanium materials. Complete
dissolution of alloying elements in the titanium matrix resulted in a good
combination of mechanical properties. Examples of alloys chosen for possible
application were Ti1.52.0%Mo0.7%TiO2 and Ti2%Al2%Mo. The latter has already been
tried for manufacturing parts in automotive industry.

Study on threshold capabilities of a copper bromide vapor laser. This paper
presents theoretical and simulation results for the operating parameters of a
copper bromide CBr laser. The CuBr active medium finds applications as both as a
laser source and a vapor amplifier. A methodology is developed to serve as the
basis for the solution of a two-dimensional quasi-stationary heat conductivity
equation on the cross-section of the gas tube for modeling the temperature of
the neutral gas and the electron temperature of the discharge. This methodology
makes it possible to determine the maximum electrical power supplied and the
maximum electron temperature in terms of thermal ionization and electric
ionization resistance of the gas discharge. Analytical results are applied in
computer simulations and for the assessment of parameters of an actual CuBr
laser.

Ultrasonic measurements of Young's modulus of Al2O3-based refractories at high
temperatures. A magnetostrictive ultrasonic pulse echo method, involving a
correction of the measured transit time, for the absolute measurement of Young's
modulus E at a high temperature 1800C is described. This technique is used to
investigate the variations in E for four large-grained Al2O3-based refractories
which differ in their manufacturing processes: fused casting, sintering or resin
impregnation. The results show that the usual decrease in E with increasing
temperature is only observed in pure fine ceramics with stable microstructures.
In this study, large variations in Young's modulus can occur at high
temperatures; these variations are discussed in relation to phase
transformations such as the monoclinic-to-tetragonal ZrO2 transformation,
microstructural changes microcracking, sintering and glassy phase effects grain
boundary sliding.

Molecular dynamics simulations of stress-induced phase transformations and grain
nucleation at crack tips in Fe. The molecular dynamics simulation technique is
used to study a stress-induced new grain formation mechanism at the crack tip of
a nanocrystalline -iron sample at temperatures ranging from 100 to. The stress-
induced formation of new bcc grains, created inside existing grains, is found to
occur through a metastable bcc to fcc phase transformation at the crack tip of
the sample. A NishiyamaWassermann orientation relationship is found between the
original bcc grain and the fcc phase and a KurdjumovSachs orientation
relationship is found between the new bcc grain created and the fcc transition
phase. The new grain nucleation is observed to increase with increasing
temperature and stacking faults associated with the fcc phase are observed at
the higher temperatures.

Fission gas swelling of refractory nuclear fuels. The external diametral
swelling rates of uranium oxides, nitrides and carbides at temperatures of up to
are presented. Under similar conditions, the swelling rates are seen to increase
from approximately 0.2 percent per 1020 fissions per cm3 at to 1030 percent per
1020 fissions per cm3 at. This exponential or Arrhenius relationship of swelling
rates to temperature is consistent with a diffusional creep model of swelling of
fuels by fission gas pressures at these temperatures. Arguments are presented
which show that diffusional creep processes are required in the formation of
even the smallest of gas bubbles. Mechanisms are suggested by which gas bubble
growth by diffusional creep can continue to form bubbles of larger sizes without
invoking difficult bubble migration processes. The kinetic nature of high-
temperature fission gas swelling requires the existence of a rate process
dependent upon fuel properties. It is apparent that the most probable rate-
controlling processes are the coupled processes of diffusion of gas atoms to
clusters and of diffusion of vacancies, primarily Schottky vacancies, to both
atoms and clusters. The driving force for vacancy flow to the sites of gas atoms
is initially the lattice strain energy of the individual gas atoms and
subsequently the pressure of gas atoms in clusters or bubbles. This dynamic
driving force is reduced by the passive, temperature-independent force called
surface tension, but the former is always in excess to provide kinetic action
toward the equilibrium described by surface tension.

Investigating the Potential Use of Papaya Leaf Extract as Natural Dyes in the
Textile Industry. Synthetic dyes are widely used in the majority of the large
textile industry. The use of synthetic dyes can cause water pollution from
sewage disposal of the textile industry. Some types of synthetic dyes contain
heavy metals that are harmful to human health and can damage the environment.
With increasing awareness of the current environmental problems, people begin to
focus on returning back to natural dyes. These natural dyes can be extracted
from various parts of plants, such as leaves, flowers, fruit, wood or stems, and
roots. Papaya leaves have the potential to be used as a basic ingredient to make
natural dyes due to fairly high chlorophyll content. Therefore, we took the
initiative to conduct research on the production of natural dyes from papaya
leaf extract. Papaya leaf extract was produced by using a solid-liquid
extraction process using two different solvents, ethanol 96% and n-hexane. From
the results of the study, it was found that the most optimum extract results in
the extraction process was about 2.20% of the raw material of dried papaya
leaves by using ethanol solvent. The prepared cotton cloth was then colored with
papaya leaf extract through three simple steps, namely: mordanting, dyeing, and
fixation. Fabric staining results then tested its fastness by two methods,
namely the rub method and the washing method with soap. From the test results it
was found that the fabric which was dyed with papaya leaf extract was not too
resistant to fade from rubbing and soap washing. Therefore, further research is
needed, such as using other agents during the mordanting and fixation processes.

photodetector showed a 15% enhanced external quantum efficiency EQE compared to
a planar MIS photodetector, and indicated a flat response over a broad range of
wavelength from the visible to IR spectra. In addition, the EQE of the nanocone
device exhibited a stable response with respect to the angle of incidence, which

Creep characteristics of wire-drawn Cu-20%Nb. In this study the creep
deformation and rupture characteristics of a wire-drawn Cu-20%Nb composite are
investigated at and compared with the results obtained from pure copper. The
results show that the creep rupture strength of Cu-20%Nb is considerably higher
than that for pure copper. The rupture strength of Cu-20%Nb increases up to a
certain draw ratio, in contrast to the room temperature strengthening. The
stress exponents n are in the range 6.68.1 for Cu-20%Nb, in comparison with 2.75
in pure copper. The increase in the creep strength and the higher stress
exponent values in the Cu-20%Nb are associated with the reduction in the power
law creep damage mechanism. This is due to the constraint introduced on the
matrix creep flow by the niobium phase rather than the development of high
threshold stress values. While the increase in the length of niobium filaments
and reduction in interfilament spacing with increasing draw ratio increase the
constraint on the creep flow of the matrix, they also enhance the creep damage
caused by the diffusion mechanisms because of the easy diffusion paths along the
niobium filaments and the reduction in the matrix gain size.

of the Mg-6.0wt.%Zn-0.5wt.%Zr Alloy. The extruded Mg-6.0wt.%Zn-0.5wt.%Zr ZK60
alloys with 0.5wt.% and 1.0wt.% Y additions were prepared. The microstructures
and tensile properties of the alloys aged in different conditions were
investigated. The results show that the specimen with 1.0wt.% Y additions and
aged at for 15 h had the best tensile strength. The ultimate tensile strength
and yield strength reached 365MPa and 352MPa, respectively. The grain
refinement, the formation of the fine dispersed MgZn particles and the WMg3Zn3Y2
ternary phase may be the main reasons for the improvement. The average grain
size reached to ~ 3m. The size of the fine and dispersed particles was only
several nanometers and the particle number density N was very high. The
crystallographic characteristics of the ternary WMg3Zn3Y2 phase were studied by
the transmission electron microscope and selected area electron diffraction
techniques. The crystallographic orientation relationship between the W phase

Investigation and Analysis on Crystallization of Tunnel Drainage Pipes in
Chongqing. A lot of crystallizations exist on the inner wall of tunnel drainage
pipes in Chongqing. Tunnel support structure often bears larger load than usual
because the tunnel drainage pipes are blocked easily by the crystals and the

site investigations and laboratory tests of crystals and groundwater were
completed. Some valuable results have been obtained. Firstly, the
crystallizations are usually discovered in drainage pipe exits of tunnels which
are under construction in Chongqing. Furthermore, the results of XRD have
confirmed that the crystals are calcite. And calcite morphology could be found
in most SEM images. But there are other morphologies in these images other than
calcite because calcite is often influenced by some factors, such as important
ions in groundwater, pH of groundwater, kinetics effect, and so on. Finally,
some steps and solutions to solve blocking of tunnel drainage pipes caused by
crystallization are suggested. One of the best solutions is that some special
materials which could prevent crystals from being attached to pipes are coated
on the inner surface of drainage pipes. The results could contribute to
understand the crystallization phenomenon profoundly and help solve the similar
situations of tunnel drainage pipe blocking.

Effects of the 1 precipitates on mechanical and damping properties of ZK60
magnesium alloy. A new approach to improve the damping capacity and mechanical
properties of ZK60 magnesium alloy at the same time is discovered by introducing
the 1 MgZn2 precipitates. The 1 precipitates are formed in the alloy experienced
solution treatment and subsequent aging at for 18 h in this study. The
synchronous improvement in mechanical and damping properties of the alloy is
mainly due to the coherent orientation relationships between the 1 phase and the
-Mg matrix, and the shearing or bypassing of dislocations on the 1 precipitates
depending on their sizes and spacing. The modified Granato-Lcke G-L model is
presented in this work to analyze the favorable damping capacity of the as-aged
ZK60 alloy and the interaction between the 1 precipitates and the mobile
dislocations is a new source of energy-dissipation.

Kinetics of oxide crystal growth in the transition regime between Cabrera-Mott
and Wagner thickness regions. We present a computational model for laser-induced
Wagner oxidation in air of metals. We assume that oxidation is diffusion
limited, but that the diffusion constant is a function of temperature. We
suppose that there are not temperature gradients in the metal, and that the
ambient temperature remains constant. Losses include convection and Stefan-
Boltzmann terms; from the oxide-air surface at the focal spot these are modelled
explicitly, and from the metal-oxide surfaces away from the focal spot they are
approximated. We plot the rate of oxide layer growth as a function of laser
power and time. The parabolic rate law in the case of a laser-induced oxidation
process seems to be valid from the thickness of the oxide layer of about 0.5 m
at long times and high powers, but it is not true for the very beginning of the
process for the metals without native oxide layers. At lower powers the validity
of the Wagner parabolic law takes place at later times of irradiation and the
mechanism of oxidation is governed by the temperature gradient in the oxide film
arising during scale growth. Comparison with experiment is made for the case of
vanadium/vanadium oxide systems.

Composition dependence of electrical properties of simultaneously evaporated
SbSe thin films. Amorphous thin films of SbSe are prepared using the three-
temperature method. The films are prepared with atomic compositions from 590
at.% Sb. The electrical resistivity, Hall voltage and thermoelectric power of
annealed samples have been measured in the temperature range 25 to. On heat
treatment the sharp fall of resistance of the annealed films is attributed to
radical structural transformation from amorphous to crystalline. Electrical
resistivity, Hall constant and thermoelectric power are found to vary with
thickness and composition of the film.

Surface electronic properties of H-terminated diamond in contact with adsorbates
and electrolytes. A comprehensive summary of surface electronic properties of
undoped hydrogen terminated diamond covered with adsorbates or in electrolyte
solutions is given. The formation of a conductive layer at the surface is
characterized using Hall effect, conductivity, contact potential difference CPM,
scanning electron microscopy SEM, and cyclic voltammetry experiments. Data are
from measurements on homoepitaxially grown CVD diamond films with atomically
smooth hydrogen terminated surfaces. The data show that due to electron transfer
from the valence band into empty states in of the electrolyte, a highly
conductive surface layer is generated. Holes propagate in the layer with
mobilities up to 350 cm2/Vs. The sheet hole density in this layer is in the
range 1011 to 5 1012 cm2, and dependents on pH of the electrolyte or adsorbate.
This has been utilized to manufacture ion sensitive field effect transistors
ISFET from diamond. The drain source conductivity of single crystalline CVD
diamond is pH dependent, with about 66 mV/pH, which is in reasonable agreement
with the Nernst law. Due to strong coulomb repulsion between positive ions in
the electrolyte and the H+-surface termination of diamond, an enlarged tunneling
gap is established which prevents electronic interactions between the
electrolyte and diamond. This is a virtual gate insulator of diamond Application
of potentials larger than the oxidation threshold of +0.7 V pH 13 to +1.6 V pH 1
gives rise to strong leakage currents and to partial surface oxidation. In
addition, the electronic interaction of diamond with redox couples is
characterized using cyclic voltammetry experiments. The results are well
described by the transfer doping model which accounts for the specific
properties of undoped diamond immersed in electrolyte solutions are covered
simply by adsorbates. In addition, numerical solutions of the Schrodinger and
Poisson equations are used to show that the density of state distribution of
unoccupied valence band states in case of a perfect interface would be governed
by two-dimensional properties 2D. 2006 WILEY-VCHVerlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

The Effect of Mould Constraints on the 0.2% Proof Stress of AsCast MgAlAlloys.
When a casting solidifies and cools down in a metallic mould, stresses and
strains develop as a result of uneven temperature distributions, metal shrinkage
and mould constraints. At ejection from the mould, the casting usually springs
back slightly when the elastic part of the strain is released. However, due to
the low flow stress at high temperatures it is likely that the casting also has
experienced some plastic deformations, meaning that the dislocation density has
increased. This paper discusses how the existence of remaining plastic
deformations affects the initial flow behavior and the yield strength during
tensile testing of as cast MgAl alloys with different degrees of mould
constraints.

Device structures of Perovskite solar cells: A critical review. In recent years,
perovskite solar cellshave been in huge demand because of their ease of
production, low cost, flexibility, long diffusion length, lightweight, and
higher performance compared to their counterparts. Thehave demonstrated
remarkable progress with PCE up to 25.7% using FAPbI3 as an active layer
component. However, the commercial viability of perovskite solar cells has been
restricted by a wide range of factors, such as lower PCE and device stability.
Further, the photocurrents inare close to the maximum Shockley- Queisser SQ
limit. The focus now is on enhancing the open-circuit voltage and fill factor
through modifying charge-selective contacts, the morphology of perovskite
material, and interface modification. The large grain size, uniformity, and
coverage area distinguish the crucial factors affecting the PCE of Long-term
device stability and degradation mechanisms have also shown significant
dependence on the device structure. Therefore, the tailoring of the device
structure continues to play a crucial role in the devices performance and
stability. In this review, the illustration of the structural development of
perovskite solar cells, including advanced interfacial layers and their
associated parameters, has been discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges

Cellular Functionality on Nanotubes of Ti-30TaAlloy. Recent studies have
identified strong correlations between anodized metals and the production of
highly biomimetic nanoscale topographies. These surfaces provide an interface of
enhanced biocompatibility that exhibits a high degree of oxidation and surface
energy. In this study, Human dermal fibroblasts HDF, neonatal were utilized to
evaluate the biocompatibility of Ti-30Ta nanotubes after 1 day of culture. The
anodization process was performed in an electrolyte solution containing HF48 %
and H2SO498 % in the volumetric ratios 1:9 with the addition of 5% dimethyl
sulfoxide DMSO at 35V for 40 min. Cellular analysis identified improved
fibroblast functionality on the nanotube surface, showing increased elongation,
and extracellular matrix production on the Ti-30Ta nanotubes. The results
presented identify improved cellular interaction on Ti-30Ta nanotubes as
compared to the control substrates. Thus, the formation of the nanotube on
Ti30Ta alloy may have potential application as interface for implantable
devices.

Diffusion Kinetics in Binary Liquid Alloys with Ordering and Demixing
Tendencies. Theoretical relationship between collective and tracer diffusion
coefficients has been derived and tested for different types of binary melts: i
with an ordering tendency case study on NiAl and NiZr melts and ii with a
demixing tendency case study on CuAg melts. The obtained relationship explicitly
demonstrates microscopic cross-correlation effects in the kinetics of collective
diffusion. Our approach incorporates molecular dynamics calculations, modelling
and statistical mechanical analysis based on fundamental concepts of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem, generalized Langevin equation and Mori-Zwanzig
formalism. We also applied the developed theory to interpret recent available
experimental data as well as our molecular dynamics data of diffusion kinetics
in different types of binary melts: with chemical ordering and contrarily with
demixing tendency.

In vitro evaluation of electrochemically bioactivated Ti6Al4V3 D porous
scaffolds. Triply periodic minimal surfaces TPMS are known for their advanced
mechanical properties and are wrinkle-free with a smooth local topology. These
surfaces provide suitable conditions for cell attachment and proliferation. In
this study, the in vitro osteoinductive and antibacterial properties of
scaffolds with different minimal pore diameters and architectures were
investigated. For the first time, scaffolds with TPMS architecture were treated
electrochemically by plasma electrolytic oxidation PEO with and without silver
nanoparticles AgNPs to enhance the surface bioactivity. It was found that the
scaffold architecture had a greater impact on the osteoblast cell activity than
the pore size. Through control of the architecture type, the collagen production
by osteoblast cells increased by 18.9% and by 43.0% in the case of additional
surface PEO bioactivation. The manufactured scaffolds demonstrated an extremely
low quasi-elastic modulus comparable with trabecular and cortical bone, which
was 510 times lower than that of bulk titanium 6.411.4 GPa vs 100105 GPa. The
AgNPs provided antibacterial properties against both gram-positive and gram-
negative bacteria and had no significant impact on the osteoblast cell growth.
Complex experimental results show the in vitro effectiveness of the PEO-modified
TPMS architecture, which could positively impact the clinical applications of
porous bioactive implants. 3D printed titanium scaffolds Electrochemical

Preliminary Experimental Investigation on the Strength and Air Permeability of
Reactive Powder Concrete. A new reinforced concrete foundation system is being
proposed to store renewable energy through the compressed air energy storage
technology. For this application, the concrete is required to resist
considerable tensile strength and to have low air permeability, which is not
observed in normal concrete. Therefore, this paper is proposing to use reactive
powder concrete for the suggested foundation system. Reactive powder concrete
RPC is obtained by introducing either micro-cementitious materials like silica
fume or fine powders like crushed quartz into the concrete mixture from where
coarse aggregates had been removed. RPC has low water content and dense particle
packing which lead to high strength and low air permeability characteristics.
This paper conducts preliminary experimental investigations on the strength and
air permeability of the RPC. Two important mix design parameters are studied
including water-to-binder ratio ad silica fume content. Preliminary correlations
between mix design parameters and strength/air permeability are developed. From
the preliminary test results, it is concluded that the reactive powder concrete
has potential to meet the high strength and low air permeability requirements,
and is suitable for the proposed energy storage foundation system.

Influence of High-Energy Milling and Sintering Cycle on Obtaining TiAl from
Elemental Ti and AlPowders. The present work studies the influence of high-
energy milling HEM and sintering cycle of Ti and Al powders on the obtainment of
TiAl. This study shows that HEM modifies the diffusion processes during the
sintering stage. The ignition temperature of the exothermic reaction SHS that
occurs between Ti and Al, was considered as the key parameter of the sintering
process, leading to the study of sintering cycles that avoid uncontrolled
processes caused by the SHS reaction. The samples were obtained by cold uniaxial
and isostatic pressing, pre-sintered at different temperatures, and then heated
up to the sintering temperature. This study also shows the effect of powder
additions processed by HEM on the sintering behavior of blended elemental Ti and
Al powder compacts.

Mesoscale Simulation of Grain Growth. Simulation is becoming an increasingly
important tool, not only in materials science in a general way, but in the study
of grain growth in particular. Here we exhibit a consistent variational approach
to the mesoscale simulation of large systems of grain boundaries subject to
Mullins Equation of curvature driven growth. Simulations must be accurate and at
a scale large enough to have statistical significance. Moreover, they must be
sufficiently flexible to use very general energies and mobilities. We introduce
this theory and its discretization as a dissipative system in two and three
dimensions. The approach has several interesting features. It consists in
solving very large systems of nonlinear evolution equations with nonlinear
boundary conditions at triple points or on triple lines. Critical events, the
disappearance of grains and and the disappearance or exhange of edges, must be
accomodated. The data structure is curves in two dimensions and surfaces in
three dimensions. We discuss some consequences and challenges, including some
ideas about coarse graining the simulation.

Local stress modification during in situ transmission electron microscopy
straining experiments. The stress distribution in a foil strained in situ in a
transmission electron microscope is strongly affected by the polished depression
and the hole. In the present study, this effect has been investigated in detail
on a FeSi foil plastically deformed under uniaxial straining in transmission
electron microscopy. The slip-trace direction varied considerably around the
hole, indicating local changes of the macroscopic slip plane. Since non-
crystallographic slip occurs in FeSi under conditions used in the experiment and
the crystallographic relation between the macroscopic slip plane and the tensile
stress direction is known, the local tensile axes could be established. It was
found that the deviations of the local tensile stress axis from the external
stress axis may be as large as 60. The stress distribution determined
experimentally is compared with an analytical solution as well as a finite
element analysis of the problem.

On the Stability of-SiCSingle Crystals at High Temperatures. The-6H polytypic
transition in-SiC single crystals is studied by means of diffuse X-ray
scattering DXS coupled with transmission electron microscopy TEM. TEM reveals
that the partially transformed SiC crystals contain regions of significantly
transformed SiC characterized by a high density of stacking faults co-existing
with regions of pure-SiC. The simulation of the diffuse intensity allows to
determine both the volume fraction of transformed material and the
transformation level within these regions. It is further shown that the
evolution with time and temperature of the transition implies the multiplication
and glide of partial dislocations, the kinetics of which are quantified by means
of DXS.

Hydrogen-induced cracking of an aluminum single crystal: An atomistic
simulation. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of hydrogen on
the crack tip mechanism of an Al single crystal. A 121 1 1 1 plane/front crack
system model with a varying hydrogen concentration was investigated based on a
molecular dynamics MD framework employing an angular-dependent interatomic
potential ADP. The incipient crack tip event was analyzed using a mixed-mode
displacement solution for mode-I and mode-II crack tip fields. The critical
stress intensity factor for the onset of the crack tip deformation event was
evaluated. A detailed description based on a von Mises atomic shear strain
analysis revealed that the presence of hydrogen near a crack tip significantly
inhibited the activities of emitted partial dislocations. The hydrogen locking
of dislocations near a crack tip was found to facilitate the local amorphization
of the crack tip, which considerably reduced the critical stress intensity
factor for the onset of crack growth. The effect of the loading mode on the
atomic-scale mechanism of the hydrogen embrittlement HE was further analyzed,
and the explicit dependence of in-plane shear loading was observed.

Effect of the Reinforcement Volume Fraction on Mechanical Alloying of AA2124
SiCComposite. Mixtures of AA2124 aluminum alloy powder and SiC particles at
volume fractions of 10 vol.% and 20 vol.% were milled in a high energy planetary
ball mill under an argon atmosphere, for times of 2.5h to 60 h, aiming to
produce Al alloy-SiC nanocomposites. Optical microscopy MO and scanning electron
microscopy SEM were used to evaluate the morphological and microstructural
evolution of the powder composite, occurred during mechanical alloying. The
crystallite size was determined using the Williamson-Hall method to analyze the
X-ray peak broadening. It was observed that increasing the volume fraction of
SiC, the mechanical alloying stages were accelerated: a finer composite powder
was obtained at a shorter milling time as well as the morphology of the
particles became more equiaxed. The XRD analysis showed the reduction of
crystallite size of the aluminum alloy matrix with increasing milling time and
that this effect is more pronounced with high volume fraction of SiC. The
results show that the increase in the volume fraction of reinforcement particles
increases the work hardening and fracture occurrence in the aluminum alloy
powder during the milling, affecting the structural evolution of the composite.

Cell Immobilization Strategies for Tissue Engineering: Recent Trends and Future
Perspectives. Cell immobilization is the process of localizing intact cells onto
specific regions in a device or material without the loss of requisite
biological function. Immobilization of cells can generally be performed through
physical adsorption, encapsulation, entrapment and self-aggregation. Various
types of cells, including microbial, plant, mammalian and insect cells, have
been immobilized on materials for improving the bio-synthesis, bioanalytics, as
well as cell therapy applications. Recently, cell immobilization on
biomaterials-based 3-D scaffolds has gained attention in the area of
regenerative medicine and tissue engineering wherein the transplantation of
immobilized cells has been utilized in repair, restoration or improvement of
tissue function. This chapter will majorly focus on different mammalian cell
immobilization techniques, physio-chemical properties of matrix materials
employed for cell immobilization and their applications in tissue engineering.

Fire and Corrosion Resistances of Intumescent Nano-coating Containing Nano-SiO2
in Salt Spray Condition. The nano-concentrates and flame retardant nano-coating
were prepared in thhis study. The effect of nano-SiO2 on the corrosion
resistance and fire resistance of ammonium polyphosphate-pentaerythritol-
melamine APP-PER-MEL coating was investigated by differential thermal analysis
DTA, scanning electron microscopy SEM, effective thermal conductivity lambda/d,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS and fire protection test. The chemical
action and endothermic effect of ammonium polyphosphate, pentaerythritol and
melamine in traditional flame retardant coating were damaged by salt spray
condition, whereas the flame-retardant additives in the nano-coating
demonstrated the good chemical interaction in salt spray condition. The
uniformly dispersed nano-SiO2 particles could improve corrosion resistance of
the coating, and hence nano-coating could remain the good fire-resistant
properties even after 500 h salt spray test.

Effect of cooling rate on the atomic and crystal structure of rapidly cooled
Fe75Si15B10. The alloy Fe75Si15B10 was formed as ribbon by melt spinning and as
powder by gas-water atomization and by spark erosion in dodecane and liquid
argon. The 27 m ribbon and 2030 m particles formed by spark erosion in dodecane
were completely amorphous while the gas-water-atomized 2030 m particles and the
particles spark eroded in liquid argon were about 50% and 80%90% crystalline
respectively. The cooling rate for the ribbon was 10 s 1 and that for the 2030 m
particles spark eroded in dodecane was in excess of 5 10 s 1 . The cooling rate
of the particles spark eroded in liquid argon was about 5 10 s 1 ; the cooling
rate for the gas-water-atomized particles was therefore between 5 10 5 and 10 s
1 . It appears that Fe75Si15B10 is not an easy alloy to obtain in the amorphous
form and that the difference between the cooling rate required to form
completely crystalline material and that to form completely amorphous material
is less than an order of magnitude.

Effect of Membrane Properties on Performance of Membrane Distillation for
Ammonia Removal. Membrane distillation MD has received much attention in recent
years as an alternative technology for the removal of volatile compounds from
industrial waters. The microporous hydrophobic membrane utilised in MD allows
only vapour passing through and the process selectivity is essentially
determined by the liquid-vapour equilibrium conditions existing at the liquid-
membrane interface. In this study, a series of asymmetrically structured
polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF hollow fibre membranes were fabricated and tested
for the removal of ammonia from simulated industrial wastewater. The asymmetric
membranes contain very thin skin layer with macrovoids supported underneath.
Hollow fibre MD modules with membrane area of 0.06 m2 have been assembled and
tested for dilute aqueous solutions containing ammonia at concentrations <1000
mg/L. The membranes were characterised in terms of porosity, thickness,
hydrophobicity, water permeability, surface roughness and zeta potential. Sweep
gas MD configuration was employed for all experiments and >90% ammonia removal
could be achieved. The results from the MD experiments were compared and the
effect of membranes characteristics was discussed.

In-reactor Creep Testing: Techniques. Creep is the slow, time-dependent strain
that occurs in a material at a constant stress or load. Irradiation creep is the
additional strain that occurs as a result of the combined effect of irradiation
and stress in components. Performance of fuel, clad tube, and other in-core
components of a nuclear reactor can be affected by the dimensional changes
caused by creep. This article summarizes various techniques used in in-reactor

CO2 at different adsorption temperature, adsorption flow rate and impregnation
ratio. The reactor temperatures were, and and the flow rate was 50 cm 3 /min,
with an impregnation ratio of 1 and 1.5. The breakthrough time was found to
decrease with increasing of impregnation ratio of KOH and decreasing of
adsorption temperature and flow rate. The AC withOH impregnation ratio has shown
the best CO2 adsorption capacity among the adsorbents studied and the adsorption

Elastic, thermodynamic and electronic properties of LaF3 under pressure from
first principles. The elastic, thermodynamic and electronic properties of LaF3
in tysonite structure have been investigated by density functional theory method
within the frame of the local density approximation LDA. The calculated lattice
parameters of LaF3 under zero temperature and zero pressure are in good
agreement with the experimental data. The calculated elastic constants also
agree well with the available experimental data and other theoretical ones. The
results show that the c axis of LaF3 is slight more incompressible than the a
axis. It is mechanically stable up to 21GPa. The pressure dependences of the
elastic constants, Debye temperatures, Poissons ratio, sound velocity and
mechanical stability of LaF3 have also been systematically investigated. Based
on the quasi-harmonic approximation model, the thermodynamic properties of LaF3
have been studied. In the pressure range studied, the stability of the phonon is
confirmed and its change tendency is revealed. The electronic structure
calculations show that the tysonite phase of LaF3 is a direct band gap insulator
with a value of 7.74eV.

Fabrication and Evaluation of the Novel Elastomer Based Nanocomposite with
Pressure Sensing Function. A novel organic/inorganic composite material which
can work as a pressure sensor has been synthesized. This composite basically
contains nano-sized carbon particles as conductive filler into an elastomer
matrix to achieve pressure sensitive function. The superior pressure sensitive
effect was showed at 0.88vol% of carbon particles while in the previous study
the micro-sized carbon particle was required above 30vol%. In addition, nano-
sized silica particles were added to reinforce electrical insulation properties
and to improve the pressure sensing reliability of the composite. The addition
of the surface modified silica improved better both the sensing performance and
the mechanical strength than the composite containing non-modified silica
particles. These polymer-based sensors have economical advantage due to low cost
production regardless of the high performance.

Controlled bacteriostasis of tea polyphenol loaded ultrahigh molecular weight
polyethylene with high crosslink density and oxidation resistance for total
joint replacement. To avoid catastrophic bacterial infection in prosthesis
failure, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene UHMWPE, a common bearing
material of artificial joints, has been formulated with antibiotics to eliminate
bacteria locally at the implant site. However, the pressing issues regarding
cytotoxic effects and evolution of drug resistant bacteria necessitates the
development of bio-friendly bacteriostat with long bacteriostatic efficacy.
Herein, tea polyphenol extracted from nature source was introduced in UHMWPE as
a biogenic antimicrobial. Controlled antimicrobial activity was achieved by
chemical crosslinking to regulate the release of the tea polyphenol. In
addition, the crosslinking efficiency of UHMWPE blends with high loaded tea
polyphenol was significantly improved in comparison to radiation crosslinking.
The immobilized tea polyphenols also enhanced the oxidation stability of the
UHMWPE, which is essential to prolong the service life in vivo and the storage
time in vitro. The blends presented good biocompatibility, despite cell
repellent on the highly crosslinked surface. Chemically crosslinked tea
polyphenol/UHMWPE exhibited feasible properties for total joint implants, which
is promising for clinical application. Tea polyphenol/UHMWPE was fabricated to
treat periprosthetic joint infection. Controlled bacteriostasis was achieved by
regulating release of tea polyphenols. The tea polyphenols enhanced oxidation
stability and crosslink density of UHMWPE. The bacteriostatic mechanism was
revealed by the ROS and ATP leakage of bacteria.

The Effect of Strain Rate on the Tensile Deformation Behavior of Single Crystal,
NiBased Superalloys. Single crystal Nickel-based superalloys exhibit an
anomalous yield point, the yield stress increasing with temperature to a maximum
at around. Here, we demonstrate in the alloy CMSX-4 at that, although there is
virtually no effect of strain rate on the initial yield point, at slow strain
rates a second mechanism can initiate leading to a considerable softening
effect. By examining the microstructures of a series of interrupted tests, this
is attributed to the initiation of stacking fault shear after the operation of a
secondary slip system. Using high-resolution TEM, the dislocation structures are
shown to be identical in both structure and in the segregation of Co, Cr, and W,
to those observed during creep deformation of single crystal alloys, although
the conformation of the dislocations and faults differs from that observed
during creep. This drop in flow stress at low strain rates is not observed in
the alloys TMS138A and SRR99, in the former case, the improved creep resistance
of this fourth-generation alloy would require a much slower strain rate to match
the creep rate achievable at this temperature.

Tensile test of lead zirconate titanate PZT/Platinum Pt thin film. This paper
presents the results of tensile tests for lead zirconate titanate PZT/Platinum
Pt thin films of 2.15 m thickness in atmospheric air at room temperature. An
axial loading tester developed by the authors was used for the tests. The tester
was equipped with a load cell with a maximum capacity of 0.5 N and a non-contact
position measuring system based on the principle of capacitance micrometry.
Furthermore, the tester was equipped with a CCD charge-coupled device system for
measuring the displacement of the gage length. Specimens with three different
widths 50, 100 and 150 m were fabricated to study the size width of specimen
effects. The elastic moduli of the specimens with 50, 100 and 150 m width were
72.8 3.7, 75.0 1.3, 73.3 1.8 GPa, respectively. In addition, the ultimate
tensile strength of the specimens with 50, 100 and 150 m width were 263.4 21.1,
238.6 4.5, 221.1 13.9 MPa, respectively. It was observed that the width of
specimen has little effect on the elastic modulus of PZT/Pt thin films but has
an effect on the ultimate tensile strength of PZT/Pt thin films and the ultimate
tensile strength decreases as the width increases. It was assumed that the
scatter in the ultimate tensile strength of 50 m width was attributed to
delamination of PZT/Pt layers before the fracture in the tensile test. The 0.2%
offset yield strength could not be measured because the PZT/Pt thin film is very
brittle.

Super Low Loss Guided Wave Bands Using Split Ring Resonator-Rod Assemblies as
Left-Handed Materials. SRR metamaterial is used as a substrate material in a
microstrip guided wave structure to determine what the effect is of a material
with potentially excessive dispersion or loss or both. A Greens function method
readily incorporates the metamaterial permittivity and permeability tensor
characteristics. Ab initio calculations are performed to obtain the dispersion
diagrams of several complex propagation constant modes of the structure.
Analytical analysis is done for the design and interpretation of the results,
which demonstrate remarkable potential for realistic use in high frequency
electronics while using the LHM for possible field reconfigurations. Bands of
extremely low loss appear for several of the lowest order modes operating in the
millimeter wavelength regime.

A Fracture Mechanics Investigation on Crack Growth in Massive Forming. To
understand the crack growth in massive forming and to consequentially avoid
crack growth in workpieces, it is necessary to investigate its dependence on the
crack depth and thus on the state of hydrostatic stress. Prior work shows that
the crack opening displacement COD for shallow cracked tension specimens with
low stress triaxiality is twice as high as for deep cracked specimens with high
stress triaxiality. This work examines the crack growth in compression specimens
with pre-cracked cylindrical upsetting samples. The compression samples were cut
in the stress symmetry plane in order to observe crack initiation and crack
growth by a single specimen technique. In this way it is possible to observe
blunting, crack initiation and crack growth inside the upsetting specimens. The
resulting COD does not differ significantly from the values achieved in tension
samples with short surface cracks.

Rapid Dissolution of Secondary Phase in Cold-Rolling AlCuMgAlloy by
Electropulsing Treatment. The AlCuMg alloy is a precipitation-strengthening
alloy, which is traditionally dissolving lots of secondary phase and
precipitating in subsequent aging process, thus having been applied to aerospace
and automobile industry due to its low density and high strength. However, the
high temperature and long operating time needed for the dissolution of secondary
phase consume numerous energy. In this work, rapid dissolution of secondary
phase in cold-rolling AlCuMg alloy was achieved by coupling treatment of thermal
field and pulsed electric current. The energy consumption for dissolving
secondary phasewas reduced from operating 1h to operating several minutes.
Therefore, the coupling treatment of thermal field and pulsed electric current
significantly improves the dissolving rate and decreases the energy consumption.

First-Principles Calculations of Titanium Dopants in Alumina. First-principles
pseudopotential calculations were performed to investigate atomic and electronic
structures of titanium Ti dopants in alumina Al2O3. It was found that a
substitutional Ti3+ defect induced an extra level occupied by one electron
within the band gap of Al2O3. When two or more substitutional Ti3+ defects were
located closely to each other, the defect-induced levels exhibited strong
bonding interactions, and their formation energies decreased with increasing
numbers of Ti3+ defects. This indicates that association and clustering of
substitutional Ti3+ defects in Al2O3 can take place due to the interaction of
the defect-induced levels.

Photo-assisted green synthesis of silver doped silk fibroin/carboxymethyl
cellulose nanocomposite hydrogels for biomedical applications. Silver
nanoparticles AgNPs and regenerated silk fibroin RSF have recently attracted
significant interests for their potential applications in preventing wound-
related infections and in tissue engineering. Indeed, nano-silver has long been
recognized as one of the most effective antimicrobial agents, and silk fibroin
is well known for its capability of stimulating cell activities and facilitating
tissue regeneration. In this study, a green synthesis approach was used to
create a composite hydrogel CoHy of RSF stabilized with CarboxymethylCellulose-
NaCMC-Na and loaded with AgNPs. Their swelling ratios were up to 59 g/g when
tested in different physiologically relevant fluids. Material characterizations
by Scanning electron microscopy SEM with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy
EDS, and X-Ray Diffraction XRD confirmed the presence of AgNPs on the surface.
Antimicrobial properties of the CoHy samples were evaluated using agar diffusion
tests. The results showed distinct inhibition zones against major microorganisms
found in wound infections, including Escherichia coli E. coli, Staphylococcus
aureus S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis S. epidermidis, Methicillin
Resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa,
Candida albicans C. albicans and Fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans FRCA.

was similar to the cell-only control group for the first 24 h of culture;
moreover, higher cell proliferation was observed on the CoHy without AgNPs,
indicating the regenerative potentials of the RSF/CMC composite hydrogels.

A modified criterion for shear band formation in bulk metallic glass under
complex stress states. A new criterion for shear band formation in metallic
glasses is proposed based on the shear plane criterion proposed by Packard and
Schuh 1. This modified shear plane MSP criterion suggests that a shear band is
not initiated randomly throughout the entire material under stress but is
initiated at the physical boundaries or defects and at locations where the
highest normal stress modified maximum shear stress occurs. Moreover, the same
as in the shear plan criterion, the shear stress all over the shear band should
exceed the shear yield strength of the material. For a complete shear band to
form, both requirements need to be fulfilled. The shear yield strength of the
material is represented by the shear stress of the point at which the shear band
stops. The new criterion agrees very well with experimental results in both the
determination of the shear yield strength and the shear band path. C2010

Dose loss and segregation of boron and arsenic at the Si/SiO2 interface by
atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Continuum downscaling of MOSFET
devices requires of ultra-shallow junction formation. Performance of the source
and drain from B andlow energy implant and subsequent annealing is seriously
affected by the presence of the SiSiO2 interface. Dopant loss due to segregation
and dopant pileup at the interface during the transient enhanced diffusion TED
are crucial phenomena for current and future CMOS devices. In this work we have
implemented the Oh-Ward model Y.-S. Oh, D.E. Ward, Tech. Dig. Int. Electron
Devices Meet. 1998 1998 509 for the dopant behaviour at the interfaces
integrated in an atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulator. Dopant traps at the
interface can capture from or emit to either side of the interface. Furthermore,
segregation of dopants and saturation of the interface by the presence of other
species are also included.a test of the model, low energy implants through a
screen oxide have been simulated. When annealing these very shallow implants, a
pileup at the interface is observed. The mechanisms involved in this process, as
well as its dependence on the implant dose and energy are discussed.

Hot deformation behaviour of thixocast AlSiMg alloy during compression at
elevated temperatures. In the present study, the flow behaviour and constitutive
equation of a Thixocast A356 Al alloy has been studied using the hot compression
test at 450, 500 and under the strain rates of 00001, 00005, 0001 and 001 s1.
The compression flow curves exhibited an initial sharp increase with strain
followed by a moderate work hardening behaviour. The maximum stress was
decreased as the strain rate reduced and the temperature increased. At the
lowest examined temperature 450C and the highest applied strain rate 001 s1, a
flow softening behaviour was observed. This was attributed to the morphological
changes of the present precipitates.

Effects of aging on the phase transformation and sintering properties of TiO2
gels. In this study, the effects of aging on the crystalline phases, crystallite
sizes, and sintering properties of TiO2 gels were investigated by using
thermogravimetry TG, differential thermal analysis DTA, X-ray diffractometer
XRD, dilatometer and scanning electron microscopy SEM. With increasing aging
time, the hydroxyl ions existing in the anatase lattice decreased, and so the
oxygen vacancy concentration produced after calcination decreased. Consequently,
increasing aging time during sintering lowered the crystallite growth rate of
anatase. The densification of the TiO2 powders was dependent upon the aging time
which shifted the anataserutile ar-TiO2 phase transformation to higher
temperature and lowered the crystallite growth rate during sintering.

Flexural Strengthening of Damaged T-Joists with Severe Corrosion Using CFRP
Sheets. This paper evaluates the residual safety of isolated T-joists with
severe corrosion for the two extreme cases of boundary conditions, simply
supported and fixed-ended, in order to help in making decisions about the
magnitude of the necessary intervention. When the T-joist is part of a complete
slab, the boundary conditions will be in an intermediate situation between these
two extreme cases, so that it is possible to assess the safety with respect to
its degree of embedding. The research is conducted for the cases of healthy
T-joist, T-joist with complete corrosion of the lower reinforcement, and
repaired T-joists with a variable number of CFRP sheets. This work is based on
the ACI 318 load test to maintain a structure in use and proposes a Load Factor
LF, which estimates the safety reserve. The simply supported T-joists specimens
with severe corrosion do not meet the Load Factor or ACI 318 criteria, even with
a large number of CFRP sheets. On the other hand, fixed-ended cases can be kept
in use despite corrosion by applying light CFRP strengthening, and with four
sheets the initial safety is restored.

A nanometer scale surface morphology study of W thin films. Microstructure of
tungsten thin films deposited by RF-sputtering is studied as a function of their
thicknesses. These films have been deposited on 100 oriented single crystal Si
substrate and Si substrate covered by a 100-nm-thick Ti layer. The crystalline
structure is studied by X-ray Diffraction XRD and Grazing Incidence XRD GIXRD.
The surface and the cross-section morphology are observed by high resolution
Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM and Atomic Force Microscopy AFM. XRD patterns
exhibit peaks corresponding to pure W phase. GIXRD analysis shows that the more
the thickness increases, the more the film is oriented along the 110 direction.
AFM observations show that films exhibit a particular morphology constituted of
piles of platelets oriented perpendicularly to the wafer surface. These piles of
platelets are in plane randomly oriented and are sometime observed upon all the
thicknesses of the layer. This particular morphology is observed whatever the
substrate is, and is explained by thin layer growth theories.

Applicability of sol-gel processing in production of silica based optical
fibres. The production of silica based optical fibres is a mature technology and
the chemical vapour deposition techniques used to obtain high quality glass are
now well established. Sol-gel technology is associated with glassmaking at
relatively low temperatures and since the early 1980s has been actively studied
in many leading laboratories all over the world; over the past decade the number
of scientific publications in the field has dramatically increased. At present
there are still only a few industrial applications using sol-gel processing, but
the potential is growing for high technology applications including optical
materials

Effects of Variable La/CeRatio on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of
Mg-5Al-0.3Mn-1RE Alloys. Effects of variable La/Ce ratio on microstructure and
mechanical properties of Mg-5Al-0.3Mn-1RE alloys were investigated. The results
indicated that pure La or pure Ce can improve ultimate strength and yield
strength of AM50 effectively without obvious decrease of elongation, and the
effect of La is better than that of Ce. However, addition of La and Ce together
deteriorates the mechanical properties of AM50, and the valley of mechanical
properties mostly appears on La:Ce= 1:1. The existence of coarse skeleton-like
phase and less amount of Mg17Al12 phase is responsible for this.

Fatigue Crack Growth Behavior of High Manganese Austenitic TWIP Steels. Fatigue
crack growth FCG behavior of three high manganese austenitic twin-induced
plasticity TWIP steels with different stacking fault energy SFE was
investigated, aiming at studying the correlation between the FCG resistance and
the SFE of the steels. FCG tests were performed using three-point bending
specimens at room temperature at stress ratio of 0.1 under the control of stress
intensity factor range. Test results showed that the fatigue threshold values of
these steels decrease with increasing the SFE. However, in the Paris regime, the
crack growth rates of the steels do not appear to correlate directly with SFE.
These results are discussed according to the degree of fatigue crack closure and
the deformation mode of crack tip zone.

Nanodiamond for Structural Biomimetic Scaffolds. Bio-mechanically active
scaffolds for tissue engineering combining hydrophilic polymeric matrix and
nano-diamond fillers properties are presented and discussed in this paper. The
resulting scaffolding materials revealed re-markable mechanical and biological
properties to be exploited in advanced biomedical applications. The novel hybrid
material is based on 2 and 5 vol-ume % of detonation nano-diamond particles in a
hydrophilic poly-hydroxyl- ethyl-methacrylate matrix. According to its
mechanical and biological properties, the nanocomposite shows a hybrid nature.
The base analytical procedures for the preparation of the hybrid nanocomposites
and some preliminary mechanical characteristics are presented. The proposed
hybrid system has been considered for potential biomimetic, osteoconductive and
osteoinductive scaffolds application in bio-mechanically active bone scaffolds
for osteoblast, and stem cell differentiation and growth. These more rigid
hybrid nano-composites are predicted to possess improved mechanical strength
overcoming the mechanical weaknesses of traditional hydrogels clinically
utilized for bone regeneration.

Effect of sputtering power on optical properties of prepared TiO2 thin films by
thermal oxidation of sputtered Ti layers. In this research, TiO2 thin films
prepared via thermal oxidation of Ti layers were deposited by RF-magnetron
sputtering method at three different sputtering powers. The effects of
sputtering power on structure, surface and optical properties of TiO2 thin films
grown on glass substrate were studied by X-ray diffraction XRD, atomic force
microscopic AFM and UVvisible spectrophotometer. The results reveal that, the
structure of layers is changed from amorphous to crystalline at anatase phase by
thermal oxidation of deposited Ti layers and rutile phase is formed when
sputtering power is increased. The optical parameters: absorption coefficient,
dielectric constants, extinction coefficient, refractive index, optical
conductivity and dissipation factor are decreased with increase in sputtering
power, but increase in optical band gap is observed. The roughness of thin films
surface is affected by changes in sputtering power which is obtained by AFM
images.

Simulation of Melting Infiltration Process of Phase Change Material in Fiber
Porous Ceramic. According to the similarity of the infiltration continuous
equation and the thermal conductivity differential equations, the infiltration
model of molten salt to fiber porous ceramic is designed by using Fluent
software. The results can reflect the actual process of melting infiltration.
Furthermore, the influences of different infiltration ways on infiltration
process, with the same volume but different radius pillar, are simulated. It is
found that infiltration time can be shortened for pillar fibers porous ceramics
with same volume. When increasing the radius, horizontal infiltration is
superior to vertical infiltration for pillar fibers porous ceramics when &lt;1
and vice versa.
