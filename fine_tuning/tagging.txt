The Effect of Strain Rate on the Tensile Deformation Behavior of Single Crystal,
NiBased Superalloys. Single crystal Nickel-based superalloys exhibit an
anomalous yield point, the yield stress increasing with temperature to a maximum
at around. Here, we demonstrate in the alloy CMSX-4 at that, although there is
virtually no effect of strain rate on the initial yield point, at slow strain
rates a second mechanism can initiate leading to a considerable softening
effect. By examining the microstructures of a series of interrupted tests, this
is attributed to the initiation of stacking fault shear after the operation of a
secondary slip system. Using high-resolution TEM, the dislocation structures are
shown to be identical in both structure and in the segregation of Co, Cr, and W,
to those observed during creep deformation of single crystal alloys, although
the conformation of the dislocations and faults differs from that observed
during creep. This drop in flow stress at low strain rates is not observed in
the alloys TMS138A and SRR99, in the former case, the improved creep resistance
of this fourth-generation alloy would require a much slower strain rate to match
the creep rate achievable at this temperature.

Tensile test of lead zirconate titanate PZT/Platinum Pt thin film. This paper
presents the results of tensile tests for lead zirconate titanate PZT/Platinum
Pt thin films of 2.15 m thickness in atmospheric air at room temperature. An
axial loading tester developed by the authors was used for the tests. The tester
was equipped with a load cell with a maximum capacity of 0.5 N and a non-contact
position measuring system based on the principle of capacitance micrometry.
Furthermore, the tester was equipped with a CCD charge-coupled device system for
measuring the displacement of the gage length. Specimens with three different
widths 50, 100 and 150 m were fabricated to study the size width of specimen
effects. The elastic moduli of the specimens with 50, 100 and 150 m width were
72.8 3.7, 75.0 1.3, 73.3 1.8 GPa, respectively. In addition, the ultimate
tensile strength of the specimens with 50, 100 and 150 m width were 263.4 21.1,
238.6 4.5, 221.1 13.9 MPa, respectively. It was observed that the width of
specimen has little effect on the elastic modulus of PZT/Pt thin films but has
an effect on the ultimate tensile strength of PZT/Pt thin films and the ultimate
tensile strength decreases as the width increases. It was assumed that the
scatter in the ultimate tensile strength of 50 m width was attributed to
delamination of PZT/Pt layers before the fracture in the tensile test. The 0.2%
offset yield strength could not be measured because the PZT/Pt thin film is very
brittle.

Super Low Loss Guided Wave Bands Using Split Ring Resonator-Rod Assemblies as
Left-Handed Materials. SRR metamaterial is used as a substrate material in a
microstrip guided wave structure to determine what the effect is of a material
with potentially excessive dispersion or loss or both. A Greens function method
readily incorporates the metamaterial permittivity and permeability tensor
characteristics. Ab initio calculations are performed to obtain the dispersion
diagrams of several complex propagation constant modes of the structure.
Analytical analysis is done for the design and interpretation of the results,
which demonstrate remarkable potential for realistic use in high frequency
electronics while using the LHM for possible field reconfigurations. Bands of
extremely low loss appear for several of the lowest order modes operating in the
millimeter wavelength regime.

A Fracture Mechanics Investigation on Crack Growth in Massive Forming. To
understand the crack growth in massive forming and to consequentially avoid
crack growth in workpieces, it is necessary to investigate its dependence on the
crack depth and thus on the state of hydrostatic stress. Prior work shows that
the crack opening displacement COD for shallow cracked tension specimens with
low stress triaxiality is twice as high as for deep cracked specimens with high
stress triaxiality. This work examines the crack growth in compression specimens
with pre-cracked cylindrical upsetting samples. The compression samples were cut
in the stress symmetry plane in order to observe crack initiation and crack
growth by a single specimen technique. In this way it is possible to observe
blunting, crack initiation and crack growth inside the upsetting specimens. The
resulting COD does not differ significantly from the values achieved in tension
samples with short surface cracks.

Rapid Dissolution of Secondary Phase in Cold-Rolling AlCuMgAlloy by
Electropulsing Treatment. The AlCuMg alloy is a precipitation-strengthening
alloy, which is traditionally dissolving lots of secondary phase and
precipitating in subsequent aging process, thus having been applied to aerospace
and automobile industry due to its low density and high strength. However, the
high temperature and long operating time needed for the dissolution of secondary
phase consume numerous energy. In this work, rapid dissolution of secondary
phase in cold-rolling AlCuMg alloy was achieved by coupling treatment of thermal
field and pulsed electric current. The energy consumption for dissolving
secondary phasewas reduced from operating 1h to operating several minutes.
Therefore, the coupling treatment of thermal field and pulsed electric current
significantly improves the dissolving rate and decreases the energy consumption.

First-Principles Calculations of Titanium Dopants in Alumina. First-principles
pseudopotential calculations were performed to investigate atomic and electronic
structures of titanium Ti dopants in alumina Al2O3. It was found that a
substitutional Ti3+ defect induced an extra level occupied by one electron
within the band gap of Al2O3. When two or more substitutional Ti3+ defects were
located closely to each other, the defect-induced levels exhibited strong
bonding interactions, and their formation energies decreased with increasing
numbers of Ti3+ defects. This indicates that association and clustering of
substitutional Ti3+ defects in Al2O3 can take place due to the interaction of
the defect-induced levels.

Photo-assisted green synthesis of silver doped silk fibroin/carboxymethyl
cellulose nanocomposite hydrogels for biomedical applications. Silver
nanoparticles AgNPs and regenerated silk fibroin RSF have recently attracted
significant interests for their potential applications in preventing wound-
related infections and in tissue engineering. Indeed, nano-silver has long been
recognized as one of the most effective antimicrobial agents, and silk fibroin
is well known for its capability of stimulating cell activities and facilitating
tissue regeneration. In this study, a green synthesis approach was used to
create a composite hydrogel CoHy of RSF stabilized with CarboxymethylCellulose-
NaCMC-Na and loaded with AgNPs. Their swelling ratios were up to 59 g/g when
tested in different physiologically relevant fluids. Material characterizations
by Scanning electron microscopy SEM with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy
EDS, and X-Ray Diffraction XRD confirmed the presence of AgNPs on the surface.
Antimicrobial properties of the CoHy samples were evaluated using agar diffusion
tests. The results showed distinct inhibition zones against major microorganisms
found in wound infections, including Escherichia coli E. coli, Staphylococcus
aureus S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis S. epidermidis, Methicillin
Resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa,
Candida albicans C. albicans and Fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans FRCA.
Cytocompatibility studies with rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cellsin
vitro showed that the adhesion density of BMScs on the CoHy loaded with 1 mg/mL
was similar to the cell-only control group for the first 24 h of culture;
moreover, higher cell proliferation was observed on the CoHy without AgNPs,
indicating the regenerative potentials of the RSF/CMC composite hydrogels.

A modified criterion for shear band formation in bulk metallic glass under
complex stress states. A new criterion for shear band formation in metallic
glasses is proposed based on the shear plane criterion proposed by Packard and
Schuh 1. This modified shear plane MSP criterion suggests that a shear band is
not initiated randomly throughout the entire material under stress but is
initiated at the physical boundaries or defects and at locations where the
highest normal stress modified maximum shear stress occurs. Moreover, the same
as in the shear plan criterion, the shear stress all over the shear band should
exceed the shear yield strength of the material. For a complete shear band to
form, both requirements need to be fulfilled. The shear yield strength of the
material is represented by the shear stress of the point at which the shear band
stops. The new criterion agrees very well with experimental results in both the
determination of the shear yield strength and the shear band path. C2010

Dose loss and segregation of boron and arsenic at the Si/SiO2 interface by
atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Continuum downscaling of MOSFET
devices requires of ultra-shallow junction formation. Performance of the source
and drain from B andlow energy implant and subsequent annealing is seriously
affected by the presence of the SiSiO2 interface. Dopant loss due to segregation
and dopant pileup at the interface during the transient enhanced diffusion TED
are crucial phenomena for current and future CMOS devices. In this work we have
implemented the Oh-Ward model Y.-S. Oh, D.E. Ward, Tech. Dig. Int. Electron
Devices Meet. 1998 1998 509 for the dopant behaviour at the interfaces
integrated in an atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulator. Dopant traps at the
interface can capture from or emit to either side of the interface. Furthermore,
segregation of dopants and saturation of the interface by the presence of other
species are also included.a test of the model, low energy implants through a
screen oxide have been simulated. When annealing these very shallow implants, a
pileup at the interface is observed. The mechanisms involved in this process, as
well as its dependence on the implant dose and energy are discussed.

Hot deformation behaviour of thixocast AlSiMg alloy during compression at
elevated temperatures. In the present study, the flow behaviour and constitutive
equation of a Thixocast A356 Al alloy has been studied using the hot compression
test at 450, 500 and under the strain rates of 00001, 00005, 0001 and 001 s1.
The compression flow curves exhibited an initial sharp increase with strain
followed by a moderate work hardening behaviour. The maximum stress was
decreased as the strain rate reduced and the temperature increased. At the
lowest examined temperature 450C and the highest applied strain rate 001 s1, a
flow softening behaviour was observed. This was attributed to the morphological
changes of the present precipitates.

Effects of aging on the phase transformation and sintering properties of TiO2
gels. In this study, the effects of aging on the crystalline phases, crystallite
sizes, and sintering properties of TiO2 gels were investigated by using
thermogravimetry TG, differential thermal analysis DTA, X-ray diffractometer
XRD, dilatometer and scanning electron microscopy SEM. With increasing aging
time, the hydroxyl ions existing in the anatase lattice decreased, and so the
oxygen vacancy concentration produced after calcination decreased. Consequently,
increasing aging time during sintering lowered the crystallite growth rate of
anatase. The densification of the TiO2 powders was dependent upon the aging time
which shifted the anataserutile ar-TiO2 phase transformation to higher
temperature and lowered the crystallite growth rate during sintering.

Flexural Strengthening of Damaged T-Joists with Severe Corrosion Using CFRP
Sheets. This paper evaluates the residual safety of isolated T-joists with
severe corrosion for the two extreme cases of boundary conditions, simply
supported and fixed-ended, in order to help in making decisions about the
magnitude of the necessary intervention. When the T-joist is part of a complete
slab, the boundary conditions will be in an intermediate situation between these
two extreme cases, so that it is possible to assess the safety with respect to
its degree of embedding. The research is conducted for the cases of healthy
T-joist, T-joist with complete corrosion of the lower reinforcement, and
repaired T-joists with a variable number of CFRP sheets. This work is based on
the ACI 318 load test to maintain a structure in use and proposes a Load Factor
LF, which estimates the safety reserve. The simply supported T-joists specimens
with severe corrosion do not meet the Load Factor or ACI 318 criteria, even with
a large number of CFRP sheets. On the other hand, fixed-ended cases can be kept
in use despite corrosion by applying light CFRP strengthening, and with four
sheets the initial safety is restored.

A nanometer scale surface morphology study of W thin films. Microstructure of
tungsten thin films deposited by RF-sputtering is studied as a function of their
thicknesses. These films have been deposited on 100 oriented single crystal Si
substrate and Si substrate covered by a 100-nm-thick Ti layer. The crystalline
structure is studied by X-ray Diffraction XRD and Grazing Incidence XRD GIXRD.
The surface and the cross-section morphology are observed by high resolution
Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM and Atomic Force Microscopy AFM. XRD patterns
exhibit peaks corresponding to pure W phase. GIXRD analysis shows that the more
the thickness increases, the more the film is oriented along the 110 direction.
AFM observations show that films exhibit a particular morphology constituted of
piles of platelets oriented perpendicularly to the wafer surface. These piles of
platelets are in plane randomly oriented and are sometime observed upon all the
thicknesses of the layer. This particular morphology is observed whatever the
substrate is, and is explained by thin layer growth theories.

Effects of Variable La/CeRatio on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of
Mg-5Al-0.3Mn-1RE Alloys. Effects of variable La/Ce ratio on microstructure and
mechanical properties of Mg-5Al-0.3Mn-1RE alloys were investigated. The results
indicated that pure La or pure Ce can improve ultimate strength and yield
strength of AM50 effectively without obvious decrease of elongation, and the
effect of La is better than that of Ce. However, addition of La and Ce together
deteriorates the mechanical properties of AM50, and the valley of mechanical
properties mostly appears on La:Ce= 1:1. The existence of coarse skeleton-like
phase and less amount of Mg17Al12 phase is responsible for this.

Fatigue Crack Growth Behavior of High Manganese Austenitic TWIP Steels. Fatigue
crack growth FCG behavior of three high manganese austenitic twin-induced
plasticity TWIP steels with different stacking fault energy SFE was
investigated, aiming at studying the correlation between the FCG resistance and
the SFE of the steels. FCG tests were performed using three-point bending
specimens at room temperature at stress ratio of 0.1 under the control of stress
intensity factor range. Test results showed that the fatigue threshold values of
these steels decrease with increasing the SFE. However, in the Paris regime, the
crack growth rates of the steels do not appear to correlate directly with SFE.
These results are discussed according to the degree of fatigue crack closure and
the deformation mode of crack tip zone.

scaffolds for tissue engineering combining hydrophilic polymeric matrix and
nano-diamond fillers properties are presented and discussed in this paper. The
resulting scaffolding materials revealed re-markable mechanical and biological
properties to be exploited in advanced biomedical applications. The novel hybrid
material is based on 2 and 5 vol-ume % of detonation nano-diamond particles in a
hydrophilic poly-hydroxyl- ethyl-methacrylate matrix. According to its
mechanical and biological properties, the nanocomposite shows a hybrid nature.
The base analytical procedures for the preparation of the hybrid nanocomposites
and some preliminary mechanical characteristics are presented. The proposed
hybrid system has been considered for potential biomimetic, osteoconductive and
osteoinductive scaffolds application in bio-mechanically active bone scaffolds

Effect of sputtering power on optical properties of prepared TiO2 thin films by
thermal oxidation of sputtered Ti layers. In this research, TiO2 thin films
prepared via thermal oxidation of Ti layers were deposited by RF-magnetron
sputtering method at three different sputtering powers. The effects of
sputtering power on structure, surface and optical properties of TiO2 thin films
grown on glass substrate were studied by X-ray diffraction XRD, atomic force
microscopic AFM and UVvisible spectrophotometer. The results reveal that, the
structure of layers is changed from amorphous to crystalline at anatase phase by
thermal oxidation of deposited Ti layers and rutile phase is formed when
sputtering power is increased. The optical parameters: absorption coefficient,
dielectric constants, extinction coefficient, refractive index, optical
conductivity and dissipation factor are decreased with increase in sputtering
power, but increase in optical band gap is observed. The roughness of thin films
surface is affected by changes in sputtering power which is obtained by AFM
images.

Simulation of Melting Infiltration Process of Phase Change Material in Fiber
Porous Ceramic. According to the similarity of the infiltration continuous
equation and the thermal conductivity differential equations, the infiltration
model of molten salt to fiber porous ceramic is designed by using Fluent
software. The results can reflect the actual process of melting infiltration.
Furthermore, the influences of different infiltration ways on infiltration
process, with the same volume but different radius pillar, are simulated. It is
found that infiltration time can be shortened for pillar fibers porous ceramics
with same volume. When increasing the radius, horizontal infiltration is
superior to vertical infiltration for pillar fibers porous ceramics when &lt;1
and vice versa.
