Extract the concepts of this abstract, concepts can be phrases of multiple words, I want you to only give me the concepts as a list.
Prefer substantiation to be consistent when extracting concepts e.g. mixed powders heated => mixed powder heating

Below are some complex examples with IDs (Wxxxxxxx) and the concepts that should be extracted from them.
The IDs can be ignored.

Review of the anatase to rutile phase transformation. Titanium dioxide, TiO2, is
an important photocatalytic material that exists as two main polymorphs, anatase
and rutile. The presence of either or both of these phases impacts on the
photocatalytic performance of the material. The present work reviews the anatase
to rutile phase transformation. The synthesis and properties of anatase and
rutile are examined, followed by a discussion of the thermodynamics of the phase
transformation and the factors affecting its observation. A comprehensive
analysis of the reported effects of dopants on the anatase to rutile phase
transformation and the mechanisms by which these effects are brought about is
presented in this review, yielding a plot of the cationic radius versus the
valence characterised by a distinct boundary between inhibitors and promoters of
the phase transformation. Further, the likely effects of dopant elements,
including those for which experimental data are unavailable, on the phase
transformation are deduced and presented on the basis of this analysis.

Review: liquid phase sintering. Liquid phase sintering LPS is a process for
forming high performance, multiple-phase components from powders. It involves
sintering under conditions where solid grains coexist with a wetting liquid.
Many variants of LPS are applied to a wide range of engineering materials.
Example applications for this technology are found in automobile engine
connecting rods and high-speed metal cutting inserts. Scientific advances in
understanding LPS began in the 1950s. The resulting quantitative process models
are now embedded in computer simulations to enable predictions of the sintered
component dimensions, microstructure, and properties. However, there are
remaining areas in need of research attention. This LPS review, based on over
2,500 publications, outlines what happens when mixed powders are heated to the
LPS temperature, with a focus on the densification and microstructure evolution
events.

Review: environmental friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials. Lead zirconate
titanate PZT based piezoelectric materials are well known for their excellent
piezoelectric properties. However, considering the toxicity of lead and its
compounds, there is a general awareness for the development of environmental
friendly lead-free materials as evidenced from the legislation passed by the
European Union in this effect. Several classes of materials are now being
considered as potentially attractive alternatives tofor specific applications.
In this paper, attempts have been made to review the recent developments on
lead-free piezo materials emphasizing on their preparation, structureproperty
correlation, etc. In this context, perovskite systems such as bismuth sodium
titanate, alkali niobates ANbO3, etc. and non-perovskites such as bismuth layer-
structured ferroelectrics are reviewed in detail. From the above study, it is
concluded that some lead-free compositions show stable piezoelectric responses
even though they do not match the overall performance of PZT. This has been the
stimulant for growing research on this subject. This topic is of current
interest to the researchers worldwide as evidenced from the large number of
research publications. This has motivated us to come out with a review article
with a view that it would give further impetus to the researchers already
working in this area and also draw the attention of the others.

Toughening mechanisms in elastomer-modified epoxies. Some brittle epoxies can be
toughened significantly by the addition of an elastomeric phase. A great deal of
controversy still exists on the nature of the toughening mechanisms. In this
work tensile dilatometry at constant displacement rates was used to determine
whether voiding, crazing or shear banding are the deformation mechanisms.
Diglycidyl ether-bisphenol A epoxies toughened by various levels of several
types of carboxyl-terminated butadiene nitrile liquid rubber were studied. The
results indicate that at low strain rates the rubber particles simply enhance
shear deformation. At sufficiently high strain rates the rubber particles
cavitate and subsequently promote further shear deformation. No indication of
crazing as an important toughening mechanism is found. No significant effect of
rubber particle size or type can be ascertained.

Microcapsule induced toughening in a self-healing polymer composite.
Microencapsulated dicyclopentadiene DCPD healing agent and Grubbs' Ru catalyst
are incorporated into an epoxy matrix to produce a polymer composite capable of
self-healing. The fracture toughness and healing efficiency of this composite
are measured using a tapered double-cantilever beam TDCB specimen. Both the
virgin and healed fracture toughness depend strongly on the size and
concentration of microcapsules added to the epoxy. Fracture of the neat epoxy is
brittle, exhibiting a mirror fracture surface. Addition of DCPD-filled urea-
formaldehyde UF microcapsules yields up to 127% increase in fracture toughness
and induces a change in the fracture plane morphology to hackle markings. The
fracture toughness of epoxy with embedded microcapsules is much greater than
epoxy samples with similar concentrations of silica microspheres or solid UF
polymer particles. The increased toughening associated with fluid-filled
microcapsules is attributed to increased hackle markings as well as subsurface
microcracking not observed for solid particle fillers. Overall the embedded
microcapsules provide two independent effects: the increase in virgin fracture
toughness from general toughening and the ability to self-heal the virgin
fracture event.
