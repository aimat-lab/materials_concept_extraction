Transient creep of an NiAl hardened austenitic steel was analysed in the temperature range of 823 to at stresses ranging from 150 to 450 MPa in the frame work of first order reaction kinetics. The present analysis is aimed: to correlate various transient creep parameters with steady state creep rate following first order reaction rate theory to obtain correlation constants; and to arrive at a unified equation to describe primary and steady state regimes of the creep curves in terms of correlation coefficients thus derived. Good correlation of transient creep parameters with steady state creep rate has been obtained over the test conditions studied indicating that the basic mechanism of deformation is the same for all the three stages of creep. Unified equation that fits the experimental creep strain time data for different test conditions over transient and steady state regimes has been obtained in terms of correlation coefficients.

SnO2 -TiO2 heterostructures coated on zeolite Y is ascertained by X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra characterization. The photocatalytic studies suggested that the SnO2 -TiO2 /zeolite Y showed enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of photodegradation of methyl orange compared with TiO2 / zeolite Y and SnO2 /zeolite Y under UV light irradiation."

Quality of semiconductor and oxide crystals which are grown from the melts plays an important role for electronic and/or optical devices. The crystal quality is significantly affected by the heat and mass transfer in the melts during crystal growth in a growth furnace such as Czochralski or horizontal Bridgman methods. This paper reviews the present understanding of phenomena of the heat and mass transfer of the melts, especially instability of melt convection from the detailed numerical calculation, which helps to understand the melt convection visualized using X-ray radiography. Large scale simulation of melt convection during crystal growth is also reviewed. Characteristics of flow instabilities of melt convection with a low Prandtl number ratio between momentum and thermal diffusivities are also reviewed by focusing on the instabilities of baroclinic, the Rayleigh-Benard and the Marangoni-Benard, from the points of view of temperature, rotating and/or magnetic field effects during crystal growth. Oxygen concentration in grown crystals is also discussed how melt convection affects."

Binary intermetallic system, Li-M M=Ag, Hg and Tl has been systematically evaluated and optimized using self consistent tight binding linear muffin tin orbital TB-LMTO method under ambient conditions. The lattice constant, bulk modulus and its pressure derivative were calculated. The lattice constants were calculated to be 3.05, 3.20 and 3.34 A and bulk modulii were predicted to be 61.8, 50 and 37.8 GPa, for LiAg, LiHg and LiTl, respectively. Electronic band structures, partial and total densities of states were derived in B2CsCl phase for the first time. The band structures show metallic character and conductivity was mostly governed by Li-d and M-d states. Furthermore, Debye temperature, Gruneisen constant and molar heat capacity in terms of coefficients of the electronic and lattice heat capacities were estimated."

The oxidation behavior of both Pd_43Cu_27Ni_10P_20 bulk metallic glass Pd4BMG and its amorphous foam containing 45 pct porosity Pd4-AF was investigated over the temperature range of 70 C to 350 C in dry air. The results showed that virtually no oxidation occurred in the Pd4BMG at T < 250 C, revealing the alloys favorable oxidation resistance in this temperature range. In addition, the oxidation kinetics at T 250 C followed a parabolic-rate law, and the parabolic-rate constants k_p values generally increased with temperature. It was found that the oxidation k_p values of the Pd4-AF are slightly lower than those of the Pd4BMG, indicating that the porous structure contributes to improving the overall oxidation resistance. The scale formed on the alloys was composed exclusively of CuO at T 275 C, whose thickness gradually increased with increasing temperature. In addition, the amorphous structure remained unchanged at T 275 C, while a triplex-phase structure developed after the oxidation at higher temperatures, consisting of Pd_2Ni_2P, Cu_3P, and Pd_3P."

The exploration of more efficient counter electrode CE is of great significance for the development of dye-sensitized solar cells Here, the catalysis of I3 /I by Cu2ZnSnS4CZTS and its derivatives have been investigated using density functional theory DFT. By studying the geometrical and electronic properties of iodine atom adsorbed on CZTS, Cu2ZnSnS x Se4 x CZTSSe, and Cu2ZnSnSe4CZTSe, it was found that the charge transport performance of CZTS can be significantly enhanced when the S in CZTS was replaced by Se. Further investigation on the different cation sites of CZTS doped with K, V, Ir, or Pt reveals that the formation of V-substituted CZTS is energetically favorable. Adsorption energies of iodine atom and desorption energies of iodine anion on various surfaces were further calculated. The results indicated that the designed material shows a high catalytic activity for the reaction of I3 /I when the Cu2 atom in CZTS is replaced by VVCu2 . Thus, the findings could help to promote novel, high-efficiency CZTS-based CE in"

There are many abandoned lignite mines in the Tokai region of Japan. They are now being filled with materials because of the possibility of caving and collapsing or subsidence in urbanized areas above these abandoned mines. The filling material is initially in a slurry state and it solidifies with time after filling the cavities. The main material of slurry is by-products produced at a neighboring macadam factory. The utilization of by-products as filling materials could not be done until now due to the restrictions of some regulations. There are two purposes of this research. The first purpose is to examine the suitability of various recycling materials as filling materials all over Japan. The second purpose is to develop new cavity filling materials from recycling materials. It is experimentally confirmed that some of by-products can be successfully utilized as cavity filling materials.

Investment casting process is considered as an economic method for mass production of metal parts. Improvement of mold surface quality and geometric accuracy in the fused deposition rapid tooling is a major concern. In this paper, a new technique is proposed for rapid manufacturing a low pressure wax injection mold with high surface finish and high dimensional accuracy. Wax patterns produced from this mold have not only better dimensional accuracy but also better surface finish. The average relative error of dimension of wax patterns can be reduced from 1.76% to 0.66%. Surface roughness improvement rate of wax patterns of up to 85.71% can be achieved. Advantages of this technique include low manufacturing cost, simple manufacturing process and flexible process capability."

This article demonstrates the use of hybrid nanofibers to improve the biodegradation rate and biocompatibility of AM50 magnesium alloy. Biodegradable hybrid membrane fiber layers containing nano-hydroxyapatite nHA particles and polylactidePLA nanofibers were coated layer-by-layer LbL on AM50 coupons using a facile single-step air jet spinning AJS approach. The corrosion performance of coated and uncoated coupon samples was investigated by means of electrochemical measurements. The results showed that the AJS 3D membrane fiber layers, particularly the hybrid membrane layers containing a small amount of nHA 3 wt.%, induce a higher biocorrosion resistance and effectively decrease the initial degradation rate compared with the neat AM50 coupon samples. The adhesion strength improved highly due to the presence of nHA particles in the AJS layer. Furthermore, the long biodegradation rates of AM50 alloy in Hank's balanced salt solution HBSS were significantly controlled by the AJS-coatings. The results showed a higher cytocompatibility for AJS-coatings compared to that for neat Mg alloys. The nanostructured nHA embedded hybrid PLA nanofiber coating can therefore be a suitable coating material for Mg alloy as a potential material for biodegradable metallic orthopedic implants."
